Upon recalling this experience, Tajiri realized that the cable now made it possible to transfer things from one cartridge to another.[II] He noted that, until then, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing, but not for something else.[68] Combining this inspiration with his memories of catching insects and other small species, Tajiri\'s idea would eventually evolve into a virtual recreation of his boyhood experiences,[69] and an attempt to "regain the world that he had lost".[70] He would later state that the game represents "the story of a boy\'s summer day".[71]'), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt', '_id': '4cb83b17-404b-4322-b4a1-c01dcc24ea73', '_collection_name': 'Pokémon'}, page_content="After a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience points.[24] After gaining a certain amount of it, the Pokémon levels up, and its statistics rise. As its level increases, the Pokémon learns new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle.[25][26] Furthermore, many species can undergo a form of spontaneous metamorphosis called Pokémon evolution, and transform into stronger forms.[27] Most Pokémon will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve through different means, such as exposure to a certain item.[28]\nThe main idea behind Pokémon was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri was born on August 28, 1965,[29] and grew up in Machida, a suburb of Tokyo.[30] As a child, he enjoyed discovering and catching insects and other small creatures in the various ponds and fields that surrounded his town.[31][32] During Japan's economic miracle, many cities, including Machida, were significantly expanded. As a consequence, Machida's nature was largely destroyed. In his second year of junior high school,[33][34] an arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood, introducing him to video games. While studying electrical engineering at Tokyo College of Technology [ja], Tajiri began publishing a doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak. The title was inspired by the 1932 film Freaks, which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time.[35] He self-published the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17.[36][37] At the time, magazines specializing in video games did not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to fill a gap in the market.[38][39] Sometime later, Tajiri was contacted by aspiring manga artist Ken Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator.[40] Game Freak folded in the late 1980s,[36] by which point Tajiri had become a respected game journalist in Japan's fledgling video game industry.[41]"), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt', '_id': 'a12a705d-22bd-4a70-8b6f-0e78066ba40b', '_collection_name': 'Pokémon'}, page_content='In March 1989, Nintendo co-founded Ape, Inc. with Itoi. Ape\'s principal work was Mother (1989), a role-playing game written by Itoi, but it was also founded with the intent to give outside talent a chance to pitch new, innovative games.[46][51] At the time, Ape was housed in the same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo.[83] Ishihara, a friend of both Itoi and Tajiri, was involved with Ape\'s management (and would become its vice-president in 1991).[46][49] Tajiri\'s relationship with Ishihara prompted Tajiri to present his idea for Pokemon at Ape\'s office.[84][85] Present during Tajiri\'s pitch was Takashi Kawaguchi, who worked at Nintendo\'s General Affairs Department and was also a manager at Ape.[51][86] Kawaguchi brought the idea to Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, who reportedly said: "This is it. This is the idea I\'ve been waiting for."[87] By pure coincidence, Ishihara had come up with an idea for a game similar to that of Tajiri, and around the same time was discussing it with Ape. This game, Toto, involved "using the Game Boy as an insect cage". Ishihara emphasized, however, that the idea of trading creatures with the link cable was Tajiri\'s. GF and Ape agreed to merge their projects together.[88] According to Tajiri, the two teams initially collaborated on the game, but the work proved difficult, one of the reasons being that Ape was busy developing EarthBound.[89][90] Tajiri eventually figured that "rather than working with Ape, we had to do something on our own, or the project would never get finished".[89] Ape, Inc. is not credited on the final product'), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt', '_id': 'b5a36c88-ca50-46e5-a968-d426a281d149', '_collection_name': 'Pokémon'}, page_content='\nThe development contract was signed at the beginning of 1990, with a planned delivery of the game in October.[91] Tajiri directed the project, working under Ishihara.[92] Ishihara was the producer – he managed the budget, staff, and work schedule, monitored the game\'s overall progress, and served as a liaison between Game Freak and Nintendo.[88][93] Ishihara also contributed ideas to the development,[52] and helped with debugging.[94][95] Sugimori was in charge of the graphics and character design.[96] Masuda created all music and sound effects, and did part of the programming.[97] The budget that Nintendo granted to Game Freak was low.[91] Thus, Pocket Monsters was initially planned as a small, compact game, based primarily around Tajiri\'s core idea of exchanging.[79][98] However, as development progressed, GF\'s ideas and ambitions for Pokemon grew.[79] They soon realized that the game they were beginning to envision would not be easy to make. Sugimori admitted that, at the time, no one at GF had much knowledge of RPGs.

In the video games, each Pokemon has a specific cry. In Anakubo's CoroCoro manga, most Pokemon could speak. At first, the council believed there should be a mixture of Pokemon that could talk and Pokemon that could not. However, this idea was eventually discarded: the Pokemon had to make a specific cry. The council agreed that Pokemon were like animals, and while the humans and the Pokemon should be able to understand each other in the series, they should not speak each other's language.[183] It was decided that Pikachu would repeatedly say its own name in various intonations. The role of Pikachu was given to Ikue Otani. During try-outs, Yuyama had Otani voice Pikachu in normal Japanese, as well as in 'Pikachu talk', in which it only said the syllables of its name. Yuyama realized that, even in the latter style of limited communication, Otani was experienced enough to still convey the messages and emotions needed.[184]"), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'test_rag.pdf', '_id': '7d57eb65-be67-493f-824a-d0a29d4d887b', '_collection_name': 'Road Traffic Regulations'}, page_content='18.

Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the Pokémon, which is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the device.

How can I assist you today?')], 'output': 'The Pokémon franchise is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. It takes place in a shared universe where humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, which are endowed with special powers. The franchise\'s target audience is children aged 5 to 12, but it is known to attract people of all ages. The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer, with three primary goals: travel and explore the Pokémon world; discover and catch each Pokémon species in order to complete their Pokédex; and train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and have them engage in battles. Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices known as Poké Balls. Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the Pokémon, which is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the device. Once the catch is successful, the Pokémon is tamed and is under the Trainer\'s command from then on. The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on February 27, 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed \\"Pokémania\\". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world\'s highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.'}}

Upon founding, the company was housed in the same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo.[112] Co-ownership of the Pokemon property, which Ishihara helped create, was subsequently assigned to Creatures. This resulted in Pokemon having three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures, representing producer Ishihara; and Nintendo, the publisher. Anne Allison (2006) wrote that Nintendo also bought Pokemon after it was finished.[113] Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) noted that the ownership structure of Pokemon is uncommon.[114] They wrote that "Pokemon is probably the only property in the world today for which the original rights are not concentrated in a single company", like The Walt Disney Company does with their IPs.[114] Tajiri and Ishihara did consider merging Game Freak and Creatures at one point. However, Tajiri decided against it because he feared it would erase what he had built up since he was a teenager. "I felt threatened by the idea of changing how Game Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr. Ishihara", he said. "It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased to exist, then so would I".

The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside of Asia.[8][9]\nThe original full name of the franchise is Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā), which has been commonly abbreviated to Pokemon (ポケモン) since its launch. When the franchise was released internationally, the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) over the e to aid in pronunciation.[10]'), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt', '_id': '81d3f4a1-ad2d-474c-81d6-55a1d43784d2', '_collection_name': 'Pokémon'}, page_content='Ishihara aspired to create video games of his own.[111] As Pocket Monsters Red and Green were nearing completion, Ishihara founded Creatures, Inc. on November 8, 1995. Upon founding, the company was housed in the same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo.[112] Co-ownership of the Pokemon property, which Ishihara helped create, was subsequently assigned to Creatures. This resulted in Pokemon having three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures, representing producer Ishihara; and Nintendo, the publisher. Anne Allison (2006) wrote that Nintendo also bought Pokemon after it was finished.[113] Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) noted that the ownership structure of Pokemon is uncommon.[114] They wrote that "Pokemon is probably the only property in the world today for which the original rights are not concentrated in a single company", like The Walt Disney Company does with their IPs.[114] Tajiri and Ishihara did consider merging Game Freak and Creatures at one point. However, Tajiri decided against it because he feared it would erase what he had built up since he was a teenager. "I felt threatened by the idea of changing how Game Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr. Ishihara", he said. "It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased to exist, then so would I".
