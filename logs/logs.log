Chen et al. reported that, in the acute phase of HAdV-55 infection, patients with severe disease may have high levels of dendritic cells and Th17 cells . In our study, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. Three of the five patients had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted. Our results suggest that these three patients may have been relatively immunocompromised and that a lower T-cell count may be a risk\nPassage: Our study results suggest that the following may be clinical features of ARDS caused by HAdV-55: persistent high fever, rapid progression of dyspnea, need for mechanical ventilation support, elevated AST level and rapid progression from unilateral infiltrates to bilateral consolidations. These clinical features are highly similar to those of ARDS caused by other types of HAdV described in previous reports .\nPassage: T-cell-secreted cytokines have also been implicated in the development of severe disease . Specifically, a theory known as original antigenic sin proposes that memory T-cell populations with low avidity for the infecting virus of a heterologous secondary infection cause a strong pro-inflammatory response, as would any memory T-cell population activated by a secondary infection. Yet, because of their low avidity, the ability of these T cells to lyse infected cells, and thereby to protect against viral infection, may be poor . In support of OAS, a study of dengue virus-specific T-cell responses in Thai children showed that the majority of\nPassage: respiratory mucosa may also be involved in the protection against the lethal influenza challenges , even though the exact mechanisms remain to be determined further. The immunization with adenovirus vector encoding NP induced both cellular and antibody responses. It has been shown recently that influenza virus-infected cells can be eliminated by anti-M2e IgG-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis since these cells express M2 on their surface after infection . Similarly, the NP-specific antibodies may interact with the viral NP expressed on cell surface of infected cells and mediate cell lysis by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\nPassage: Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns with the pattern recognition receptors of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells .', 'step_back_context': 'Passage: The development of antiviral immune responses involves the orchestration of a complex network of innate and adaptive immune cells to promote health over disease. Natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells , CD11b and CD8a conventional dendritic cells , B cells, and CD8 T cells have all been demonstrated to be important for the generation of protective immunity to various viral infections . However, how the antiviral defense as a whole is coordinated, and in particular how the functions of different types of immune cells impact the shaping of the global immune response to viruses in vivo, is not thoroughly understood.\nPassage: T-cell-secreted cytokines have also been implicated in the development of severe disease .

In support of OAS, a study of dengue virus-specific T-cell responses in Thai children showed that the majority of\nPassage: Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation\nPassage: and to maintain self-tolerance . T lymphocyte activation culminates with the establishment of the immunological memory, providing the host with T cells more prone and efficient in responding to a reinfection by the same pathogen or upon tumor relapses . Besides, DCs are key players in humoral responses too. Indeed, they directly interact with B cells and indirectly support them by activating CD4 + T cells, leading to humoral memory. All these notions strengthen the idea that DCs represent an optimal target for immunotherapies and vaccines, acting at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity.\nPassage: An expansive history of evidence has revealed the essential role of the host immune system in preventing viral infections . The initial sensing of an invading virus by pattern recognition receptors of the host innate immune system induces the production of interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines as a part of the early host antiviral response phase. Afterwards, both the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B-cell production of neutralizing antibodies ultimately mounts an effective and specific antiviral response for optimal viral clearance. However, despite the essential need for viral control and clearance, the intensity of the antiviral immune response must'}

The second can fail when control efforts are applied unevenly across different host types , since R 0 is determined by averaging over all host types and does not directly determine the control effort required to eliminate infection.\nPassage: Very few empirical studies have attempted to determine whether urbanization is related to EID outbreaks or whether urbanization is associated primarily with other factors related to EID outbreaks. One immediate problem researchers face is defining what is rural, urban, and transitional . Some studies have used official administrative definitions of urban and rural areas, but this approach is limited in its bluntness . Other studies prioritized human population density as a satisfactory surrogate , but this approach ignores the important fact that density is not a risk factor if it is accompanied by sufficient infrastructure to handle the population.

At the other end of the spectrum both the Rhabdoviridae and Picornaviridae displayed nPH85 > 0.97, indicative of frequent host switching and hence little evidence for virus-host co-divergence.\nPassage: Although ECoV has been identified on three continents, little is known about the genetic and pathogenic diversity in field viruses. In this study, sequence and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a high level of homology between viruses detected in a donkey and a horse in two provinces in Ireland in different years. This suggests that Irish ECoVs may have low genetic diversity. Compared with the ECoVs of other countries, the N, S and p12.7 genes of the two Irish viruses were highly conserved. In contrast, the region from p4.7 and the non-coding region following the p4.7 gene had deletions or insertions .\nPassage: We confirmed that our model reproduced the observed slight downward trend in the rate of discovery since 1954 and the observed variance in the data from 1954 to 2006 . The distribution of the number of virus species discovered per year shows slight overdispersion which falls within the predicted range .

It has been shown recently that influenza virus-infected cells can be eliminated by anti-M2e IgG-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis since these cells express M2 on their surface after infection . Similarly, the NP-specific antibodies may interact with the viral NP expressed on cell surface of infected cells and mediate cell lysis by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\nPassage: Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns with the pattern recognition receptors of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells .', 'step_back_context': 'Passage: The development of antiviral immune responses involves the orchestration of a complex network of innate and adaptive immune cells to promote health over disease. Natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells , CD11b and CD8a conventional dendritic cells , B cells, and CD8 T cells have all been demonstrated to be important for the generation of protective immunity to various viral infections . However, how the antiviral defense as a whole is coordinated, and in particular how the functions of different types of immune cells impact the shaping of the global immune response to viruses in vivo, is not thoroughly understood.\nPassage: An expansive history of evidence has revealed the essential role of the host immune system in preventing viral infections . The initial sensing of an invading virus by pattern recognition receptors of the host innate immune system induces the production of interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines as a part of the early host antiviral response phase. Afterwards, both the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B-cell production of neutralizing antibodies ultimately mounts an effective and specific antiviral response for optimal viral clearance. However, despite the essential need for viral control and clearance, the intensity of the antiviral immune response must\nPassage: . Furthermore, the humanized mouse model that possess human immune cells may also serves to unravel the immune profile of a viral infection in healthy and diseased condition . For milder viruses, controlled in vivo human infections can be performed for the best mode of verification of the associations of the virus with the proposed mechanism of viral induced acute exacerbations . With the advent of suitable diseased models, the verification of the mechanisms will then provide the necessary continuation of improving the management of viral induced acute exacerbations.\nPassage: Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation\nPassage: NK cells possess unique natural cytotoxicity receptors such as NCR1 in mice, and NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46 in humans, involved in recognition of viral-and tumor-associated molecules and activation of NK cells . Influenza virus productively infects human NK cells in vitro . In mouse models of influenza virus infection, there is a substantial increase in the population of activated NK cells expressing CD107a and IFN-c in the lungs, which can lyse influenza virus-infected cells through granzyme B and perforin, and contribute to the virus control . Accordingly, NK cell-depletion or defects in NK cell activity resulted in delayed virus clearance'}

To date, MERS-CoV has not been detected in DCs tested in zoos or herds from other parts of the world . Occasionally, virus is transmitted from infected DCs to exposed humans. Subsequent transmission to other humans requires relatively close and prolonged exposure .\nPassage: but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected.

Serological techniques play a key role in various aspects of influenza surveillance, vaccine development, and evaluation and they can be used to assess the presence of antibodies to past infections and responses to a circulating influenza strain or vaccine components . From a veterinary point of view, serological and virological surveillances are necessary not only as monitoring systems for AI viruses circulating among poultry species but also as a prevention and control tool for those strains with possible pandemic potential .\nPassage: Of the top 100 human pathogens identified, 42 were either included in the GBD , or are reportable to the EC , or both. Reasons for failure to include pathogens may be that pathogenic agents cause rarely diagnosed disease , or because disease agents are diverse, e.g. pneumonia or other lung infections and gastro-intestinal symptoms or GI-tract infections . The impact of chronic disease or diseases causing low morbidity may be difficult to quantify or seen as less important . In addition, some pathogens may generally be commensals or natural biota or species existing in the environment causing opportunistic infections\nPassage: Since this study, a host of peer-reviewed reports have looked at both DCs and other animals, and the possibility that they may host MERS-CoV infection.
