Tajiri learned that the device would have a link port, and with the corresponding Game Link Cable, two Game Boys could be linked together.[63] Sometime later, Tajiri remembered an incident while playing Dragon Quest II (1987), a role-playing game (RPG) for the Famicom (NES). The game features randomly appearing items of varying rarity, including an extremely rare item called Mysterious Hat.[d] Tajiri did not encounter any, while Ken Sugimori, who was also playing the game, encountered two. Upon recalling this experience, Tajiri realized that the cable now made it possible to transfer things from one cartridge to another.[II] He noted that, until then, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing, but not for something else.[68] Combining this inspiration with his memories of catching insects and other small species, Tajiri\'s idea would eventually evolve into a virtual recreation of his boyhood experiences,[69] and an attempt to "regain the world that he had lost".[70] He would later state that the game represents "the story of a boy\'s summer day".[71]'), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt', '_id': '4cb83b17-404b-4322-b4a1-c01dcc24ea73', '_collection_name': 'Pokémon'}, page_content="After a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience points.[24] After gaining a certain amount of it, the Pokémon levels up, and its statistics rise. As its level increases, the Pokémon learns new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle.[25][26] Furthermore, many species can undergo a form of spontaneous metamorphosis called Pokémon evolution, and transform into stronger forms.[27] Most Pokémon will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve through different means, such as exposure to a certain item.[28]\nThe main idea behind Pokémon was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri was born on August 28, 1965,[29] and grew up in Machida, a suburb of Tokyo.[30] As a child, he enjoyed discovering and catching insects and other small creatures in the various ponds and fields that surrounded his town.[31][32] During Japan's economic miracle, many cities, including Machida, were significantly expanded. As a consequence, Machida's nature was largely destroyed. In his second year of junior high school,[33][34] an arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood, introducing him to video games. While studying electrical engineering at Tokyo College of Technology [ja], Tajiri began publishing a doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak. The title was inspired by the 1932 film Freaks, which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time.[35] He self-published the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17.[36][37] At the time, magazines specializing in video games did not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to fill a gap in the market.[38][39] Sometime later, Tajiri was contacted by aspiring manga artist Ken Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator.[40] Game Freak folded in the late 1980s,[36] by which point Tajiri had become a respected game journalist in Japan's fledgling video game industry.[41]"), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt', '_id': 'a12a705d-22bd-4a70-8b6f-0e78066ba40b', '_collection_name': 'Pokémon'}, page_content='In March 1989, Nintendo co-founded Ape, Inc. with Itoi. Ape\'s principal work was Mother (1989), a role-playing game written by Itoi, but it was also founded with the intent to give outside talent a chance to pitch new, innovative games.[46][51] At the time, Ape was housed in the same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo.[83] Ishihara, a friend of both Itoi and Tajiri, was involved with Ape\'s management (and would become its vice-president in 1991).[46][49] Tajiri\'s relationship with Ishihara prompted Tajiri to present his idea for Pokemon at Ape\'s office.[84][85] Present during Tajiri\'s pitch was Takashi Kawaguchi, who worked at Nintendo\'s General Affairs Department and was also a manager at Ape.[51][86] Kawaguchi brought the idea to Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, who reportedly said: "This is it. This is the idea I\'ve been waiting for."[87] By pure coincidence, Ishihara had come up with an idea for a game similar to that of Tajiri, and around the same time was discussing it with Ape. This game, Toto, involved "using the Game Boy as an insect cage". Ishihara emphasized, however, that the idea of trading creatures with the link cable was Tajiri\'s. GF and Ape agreed to merge their projects together.[88] According to Tajiri, the two teams initially collaborated on the game, but the work proved difficult, one of the reasons being that Ape was busy developing EarthBound.[89][90] Tajiri eventually figured that "rather than working with Ape, we had to do something on our own, or the project would never get finished".[89] Ape, Inc. is not credited on the final product'), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'pokemon.txt', '_id': 'b5a36c88-ca50-46e5-a968-d426a281d149', '_collection_name': 'Pokémon'}, page_content='\nThe development contract was signed at the beginning of 1990, with a planned delivery of the game in October.[91] Tajiri directed the project, working under Ishihara.[92] Ishihara was the producer – he managed the budget, staff, and work schedule, monitored the game\'s overall progress, and served as a liaison between Game Freak and Nintendo.[88][93] Ishihara also contributed ideas to the development,[52] and helped with debugging.[94][95] Sugimori was in charge of the graphics and character design.[96] Masuda created all music and sound effects, and did part of the programming.[97] The budget that Nintendo granted to Game Freak was low.[91] Thus, Pocket Monsters was initially planned as a small, compact game, based primarily around Tajiri\'s core idea of exchanging.[79][98] However, as development progressed, GF\'s ideas and ambitions for Pokemon grew.[79] They soon realized that the game they were beginning to envision would not be easy to make. Sugimori admitted that, at the time, no one at GF had much knowledge of RPGs. "We thought we could handle it, but as we began working, we realized it was going to be tough", he acknowledged.[99] Pokemon was suspended indefinitely, and GF turned their focus on other titles (see Game Freak § Games)'), Document(metadata={'source_document': 'test_rag.pdf', '_id': '7d57eb65-be67-493f-824a-d0a29d4d887b', '_collection_name': 'Road Traffic Regulations'}, page_content='18.
