 According to the study, a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection. Three of the five patients in the study had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted, suggesting that they may have been relatively immunocompromised. In contrast, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. This suggests that a higher T-cell count may be beneficial for recovery from severe HAdV-55 infection. 
 expected response: 
 The T-cell count plays a crucial role in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection, as patients with severe disease may have low T-cell counts. In the study mentioned, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts, suggesting that a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe HAdV-55 infection.

 The most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution are the absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and the lack of a close relative in a wildlife species. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 did not originate from a laboratory or a specific animal host, but rather evolved naturally over time. Additionally, the presence of over 1,100 nucleotide differences between the human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat RaTG13-CoV, distributed throughout the genome, supports the natural evolution theory.

 To effectively detect and identify pathogens, both generic and specific detection methods are needed. Generic detection methods, such as bioluminescent measurement of ATP and mass-spectrometry, can provide information about the presence of biological materials. Specific methods, including micro-arrays, immuno-assays, and real-time PCR, are required to identify the type of microbes present. Additionally, techniques like ELISA-array can be used for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses. These methods can be used in combination to provide comprehensive surveillance coverage.

 The amino acid sequence of IFITM5 is relatively dissimilar to IFITM1-3 proteins. In contrast, IFITM1-3 proteins share approximately 85% similarity with each other. This indicates that IFITM5 has a distinct amino acid sequence compared to the other IFITM proteins. The exact percentage of similarity between IFITM5 and the other IFITM proteins is not specified in the passage.

 The use of corticosteroids to suppress inflammation can have an immunosuppressive effect, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections. This immunosuppressant effect is related to the dose and treatment duration of corticosteroids. The suppression of inflammation can also lead to impaired bacterial immune response, allowing opportunistic pathogens to replace normal flora and alter the inflammatory profiles. This can result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between viruses and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases.

 Examples of viral vectors for delivering vaccines include Adenovirus vectors, Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors, and Poxvirus vectors. Adenovirus vectors are attractive due to their stable genome and ability to accommodate large amounts of genetic material. AAV vectors are non-pathogenic, replication-incompetent, and stable, making them suitable for long-term storage. Poxvirus vectors, such as attenuated derivatives of vaccinia virus and NYVAC strains, are also promising due to their large DNA-packing capacity and thermal and genetic stability.

 According to the passage, tissue resident alveolar macrophages follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung. These macrophages promote viral clearance via phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and release of cytokines and chemokines to promote immune responses. However, in some cases, the resident alveolar macrophages can be suppressed or killed by respiratory viruses, leading to a delay in pathogen clearance and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. In such cases, recruited blood-derived monocytes can differentiate into macrophages to replace the resident alveolar macrophages. 
 expected response: 
 The types of cells that follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung are myeloid cells like monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and their common precursor cells, summarized as mononuclear phagocytes.

 The provided context does not directly answer the question. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that determining asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission is crucial for effective public health control measures. The passages highlight the importance of rapid diagnostics and timely contact tracing in preventing the spread of diseases. Delays in laboratory confirmation and identification of contact details can hinder these efforts. Therefore, understanding asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission can help inform strategies for early detection and intervention, ultimately reducing the spread of the disease.

During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells.

 The most frequent clinical manifestations of human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) induced severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) include persistent high fever, dyspnea, and rapid progression to respiratory failure within 2 weeks. Additionally, bilateral consolidations and infiltrates are common clinical features. These manifestations are often accompanied by a rapid progression of respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation support and, in severe cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Elevated AST levels and a rapid progression from unilateral infiltrates to bilateral consolidations are also characteristic of HAdV-55-induced ARDS.

In our cohort, we found that severe HAdV-55 infection could cause a rapid progression of respiratory failure, with a very high failure rate for NPPV and IMV. This failure rate may be a result of the large area of consolidation that induced a severe shunt in the lung, which may lead to lack of response to positive pressure ventilation. For patients with severe ARDS, ECMO should be considered a better choice for oxygenation.', 'Title: Emergent severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by adenovirus type 55 in immunocompetent adults in 2013: a prospective observational study\nPassage: 1 × 10 in one patient.

 In response to infection, neutrophils can internalize and kill microbes. They can also perform tissue debridement and attract monocytes to initiate healing. Additionally, factors such as RANTES and CXCL10 can recruit immune cells like neutrophils to induce apoptosis. Neutrophils are the first responders to tissue damage and invading pathogens, and they play a crucial role in protecting disrupted barriers from pathogens and clearing tissue damage. 
 expected response: 
 In response to infection, neutrophils can help to resolve tissue damage, form a defense against bacteria through phagocytosis and release of antimicrobial molecules, but they can also contribute to collateral organ damage of the host when released into tissues and enhance susceptibility to post-traumatic infections. Additionally, disrupted protective barriers in combination with the presence of immunosuppressive and less responsive neutrophils can further enhance the susceptibility to post-traumatic infections.

 The premise for apathogenic forms to blunt any pathological response in the host is not explicitly stated in the provided passages. However, it can be inferred that a balanced immune response is necessary to prevent excessive inflammation and tissue damage. The passages suggest that a strong antiviral response can be beneficial for viral clearance, but it must be balanced to avoid causing harm to the host. Apathogenic forms may be able to modulate the immune response to prevent excessive inflammation and promote tolerance, thereby reducing the risk of tissue damage and disease spread. 
 expected response: 
 The premise for apathogenic forms to blunt any pathological response in the host is that they tend to induce an earlier innate response that would render it more likely that the virus would.

 Neuraminidase (NA) in the influenza virus is thought to mediate progeny virus budding from host cells. However, its functional role in infection was unclear until recent studies suggested that NA contributes to the movement of virus particles toward endocytosis regions. NA inhibitors, such as zanamivir, have been shown to suppress virus infection and completely block virus crawling and gliding motions on fetuin-coated surfaces, resulting in the immobilization of virus particles. Additionally, NA has been an attractive target for drug design, with FDA-approved clinical drugs like zanamivir and oseltamivir designed to inhibit the spread of influenza viral progeny by binding to viral surface glycoprotein of neuraminidase.

 Neuroaminidase (NA) in the influenza virus helps in the spreading of the virus by enabling progeny virus to be cleaved from its receptor and spread to other cells.

 Low levels of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells may enhance Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 by favoring HIV-1 binding to the CCR5 receptor instead of the DC-SIGNR receptor. This facilitates the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier, resulting in in utero transmission of HIV-1. Reduced expression of DC-SIGNR, particularly the membrane-bound isoforms, compromises the placental barrier's integrity and allows HIV-1-infected cells to cross. This increased susceptibility to HIV-1 transmission highlights the importance of DC-SIGNR in preventing MTCT.

 The passage does not mention MA15, but it does mention avian polymerase and its poor activity in mammalian cells. This is due to a host factor, ANP32A, which differs between flighted birds and mammals. It is likely that a similar mechanism could be responsible for the attenuation of MA15 in human cells, but this is not explicitly stated in the passage. 
 expected response: 
 The basis for the host-restriction of MVA, which is important to fully understand its attenuation, remains unknown. The large number of deletions, truncations, and mutations that occurred during the long passage history of MVA in CEF severely complicates efforts to determine those changes important for its host-range defect. Additionally, the MVA genome revealed six major deletions compared to the parent virus, and the consequent inability to efficiently produce infectious virus in most mammalian cells, suggesting that MA15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells.

 Yes, AAV has been studied as vectors for influenza. There are limited studies using AAVs as vaccine vectors for influenza, with the first study showing an AAV expressing an HA antigen inducing protective immunity in 2001. Later studies have also shown that AAV vectors expressing influenza NP and other proteins can protect against influenza challenges in mice. These studies suggest that AAV vectors may be a viable option for developing influenza vaccines.

 Serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology. Specifically, viral IgM and IgG serological tests are recommended to confirm an infection. This is because oral swabs detection may yield unreliable results, and the virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection is negative. Using these additional tests can help ensure accurate diagnosis and prevent potential misdiagnosis.

 Other tests that should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology include serum antibody titers for confirmation of infection or evidence of immunity, polymerase chain reaction assays conducted on samples from a patient's upper and lower respiratory tracts, and serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits which are likely to be developed in the near future.

 Middle- and high-income countries use an acellular pertussis vaccine for the primary vaccination series.

The findings suggest that the actual number of cases in the first half of January 2020 was significantly higher than the reported number.

 A key factor in managing emerging infectious disease threats is international collaboration and cooperation. This includes assessing the infrastructure of countries affected by communicable diseases and working together to monitor and respond to outbreaks. Sustained efforts and close collaboration between the animal health and public health sectors at community, national, and international levels are also crucial. Additionally, country-level factors, particularly the WHO key indicators, play a significant role in controlling epidemics. 
 expected response:

 SARS-CoV spreads more rapidly between hosts, while MERS-CoV has been more easily contained. The basic reproduction number (R0) of MERS-CoV has been reported to be as high as 2.5-7.2 in some outbreaks, but generally lower in Middle East countries. In contrast, SARS-CoV has a higher transmissibility in some regions, similar to its behavior in the initial outbreak. The difference in transmission may be attributed to the different receptors used by the viruses, with SARS-CoV using the ACE2 receptor and MERS-CoV using the ectopeptidase DPP4. 
 expected response: 
 Transmission of SARS-CoV is more rapid between hosts, while MERS-CoV transmission is defined as sporadic, intra-familial, often healthcare associated, inefficient and requiring close and prolonged contact. Additionally, MERS-CoV has been more easily contained compared to SARS-CoV.

 Oxidative stress in the body is caused by the production of reactive species (RS) as a result of the metabolic process. These reactive species can be either reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species. They are produced naturally in the body and can be involved in complex cellular signaling pathways. However, an imbalance or excessive production of these reactive species can lead to oxidative stress, which can contribute to the pathogenesis of many viral diseases. 
 expected response: 
 Oxidative stress in the body can be caused by a wide range of reactive species produced as a result of the metabolic process, including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. This can be magnified by the production of ROS from various cellular organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and peroxisomes. Additionally, factors such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, leptin, angiotensin II, and virus-induced cytokines can also contribute to oxidative stress in the body.

However, extensive research in the last three decades has clarified myriads of misconceptions and explored leading roles of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of many viral diseases . A wide range of the reactive species is produced as a result of the metabolic process in the body. These RS can be reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species .

The UPR alleviates ER stress by increasing transcription of the chaperone proteins and lipids that increase folding capacity in the ER, as well as upregulating other components of the secretory machinery. The UPR also decreases protein load by increasing production of the ERAD machinery that degrades misfolded proteins . Finally, the UPR reduces protein load through the attenuation of protein translation .
