Despite its widespread recognition, a comprehensive understanding of the concept remains elusive. This paper aims to provide a multidisciplinary analysis of the notion of Pokémon, drawing from fields such as biology, anthropology, and sociology.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nPokémon, a portmanteau of the words "pocket" and "monster," refers to a fictional universe of creatures with unique characteristics, abilities, and attributes.
