As well as these side effects, corticosteroids have strong immunosuppressive effects, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections, despite their potential effect in controlling excessive inflammatory response. The immunosuppressant effect of corticosteroids is related to dose and treatment duration.

Furthermore, the destabilization is further compounded by impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms . All these may gradually lead to more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles .

Besides, DCs are key players in humoral responses too. Indeed, they directly interact with B cells and indirectly support them by activating CD4 + T cells, leading to humoral memory. All these notions strengthen the idea that DCs represent an optimal target for immunotherapies and vaccines, acting at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity.\", \"Title: Natural Killer Cells Promote Early CD8 T Cell Responses against Cytomegalovirus\\nPassage: The development of antiviral immune responses involves the orchestration of a complex network of innate and adaptive immune cells to promote health over disease. Natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells , CD11b and CD8a conventional dendritic cells , B cells, and CD8 T cells have all been demonstrated to be important for the generation of protective immunity to various viral infections . However, how the antiviral defense as a whole is coordinated, and in particular how the functions of different types of immune cells impact the shaping of the global immune response to viruses in vivo, is not thoroughly understood.\", \"Title: Neutrophil heterogeneity and its role in infectious complications after severe trauma\\nPassage: After trauma, the injury induces an immediate innate immune response to protect disrupted barriers from pathogens, to clear tissue damage, and to induce healing . Many humoral and cellular mediators including leukocytes, the coagulation, and complement cascades strictly regulate these processes. However, sometimes these processes become dysregulated and severe immune mediated complications can occur . Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes of all innate effector cells, and the first responders to tissue damage and invading pathogens . These cells are able to internalize and kill microbes, as well as to perform tissue debridement and attract monocytes to initiate healing .\", \"Title: The Battle between Virus and Host: Modulation of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathways by Virus Infection\\nPassage: and cytokines, such as interleukin-1\\u03b2 , IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 are also produced. These molecules promote chemotaxis of the resident DCs toward virus-infected and dead cells. Neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, mDCs, and pDCs also migrate from the blood vessels to the site of infection. IFN-\\u03b3inducible protein 10 , monocyte chemotactic protein 1 , macrophage inflammatory protein-2 , MIP-3\\u03b1, and MIP-3\\u03b2 largely contribute to the transmigration of blood DCs. However, these blood-borne immune cells can also be infected by viruses, which can then modulate the production of various cytokines and chemokines.\", \"Title: The protective and pathogenic roles of IL-17 in viral infections: friend or foe?\\nPassage: An expansive history of evidence has revealed the essential role of the host immune system in preventing viral infections . The initial sensing of an invading virus by pattern recognition receptors of the host innate immune system induces the production of interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines as a part of the early host antiviral response phase. Afterwards, both the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B-cell production of neutralizing antibodies ultimately mounts an effective and specific antiviral response for optimal viral clearance.

Earliest replicating and evolving entities are the ribozymes or viroids fulfilling several criteria of life. RNA can perform many aspects of life and influences our gene expression until today. The simplest structures with non-protein-coding information may represent models of life built on structural, not genetic information. Viruses today are obligatory parasites depending on host cells. Examples of how an independent lifestyle might have been lost include mitochondria, chloroplasts, Rickettsia and others, which used to be autonomous bacteria and became intracellular parasites or endosymbionts, thereby losing most of their genes.
