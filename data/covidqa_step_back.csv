What role does T-cell count play in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection?,"According to the provided passages, a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe HAdV-55 infection. In a study, three out of five patients with severe disease had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted, suggesting that they may have been immunocompromised. In contrast, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. This implies that T-cells play a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV-55 viremia and survival of the host. A higher T-cell count may be associated with better outcomes in HAdV-55 infection.","The T-cell count plays a crucial role in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection, as patients with severe disease may have low T-cell counts. In the study mentioned, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts, suggesting that a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe HAdV-55 infection.","['Passage: Recent studies have shown that the immune system plays a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV viremia and survival of the host . Chen et al. reported that, in the acute phase of HAdV-55 infection, patients with severe disease may have high levels of dendritic cells and Th17 cells . In our study, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. Three of the five patients had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted. Our results suggest that these three patients may have been relatively immunocompromised and that a lower T-cell count may be a risk', 'Passage: Our study results suggest that the following may be clinical features of ARDS caused by HAdV-55: persistent high fever, rapid progression of dyspnea, need for mechanical ventilation support, elevated AST level and rapid progression from unilateral infiltrates to bilateral consolidations. These clinical features are highly similar to those of ARDS caused by other types of HAdV described in previous reports .', 'Passage: T-cell-secreted cytokines have also been implicated in the development of severe disease . Specifically, a theory known as original antigenic sin proposes that memory T-cell populations with low avidity for the infecting virus of a heterologous secondary infection cause a strong pro-inflammatory response, as would any memory T-cell population activated by a secondary infection. Yet, because of their low avidity, the ability of these T cells to lyse infected cells, and thereby to protect against viral infection, may be poor . In support of OAS, a study of dengue virus-specific T-cell responses in Thai children showed that the majority of', 'Passage: respiratory mucosa may also be involved in the protection against the lethal influenza challenges , even though the exact mechanisms remain to be determined further. The immunization with adenovirus vector encoding NP induced both cellular and antibody responses. It has been shown recently that influenza virus-infected cells can be eliminated by anti-M2e IgG-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis since these cells express M2 on their surface after infection . Similarly, the NP-specific antibodies may interact with the viral NP expressed on cell surface of infected cells and mediate cell lysis by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.', 'Passage: Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns with the pattern recognition receptors of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells .', 'Passage: The development of antiviral immune responses involves the orchestration of a complex network of innate and adaptive immune cells to promote health over disease. Natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells , CD11b and CD8a conventional dendritic cells , B cells, and CD8 T cells have all been demonstrated to be important for the generation of protective immunity to various viral infections . However, how the antiviral defense as a whole is coordinated, and in particular how the functions of different types of immune cells impact the shaping of the global immune response to viruses in vivo, is not thoroughly understood.', 'Passage: T-cell-secreted cytokines have also been implicated in the development of severe disease .

Yet, because of their low avidity, the ability of these T cells to lyse infected cells, and thereby to protect against viral infection, may be poor . In support of OAS, a study of dengue virus-specific T-cell responses in Thai children showed that the majority of', 'Passage: Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation', 'Passage: and to maintain self-tolerance . T lymphocyte activation culminates with the establishment of the immunological memory, providing the host with T cells more prone and efficient in responding to a reinfection by the same pathogen or upon tumor relapses . Besides, DCs are key players in humoral responses too. Indeed, they directly interact with B cells and indirectly support them by activating CD4 + T cells, leading to humoral memory. All these notions strengthen the idea that DCs represent an optimal target for immunotherapies and vaccines, acting at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity.', 'Passage: An expansive history of evidence has revealed the essential role of the host immune system in preventing viral infections . The initial sensing of an invading virus by pattern recognition receptors of the host innate immune system induces the production of interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines as a part of the early host antiviral response phase. Afterwards, both the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B-cell production of neutralizing antibodies ultimately mounts an effective and specific antiviral response for optimal viral clearance. However, despite the essential need for viral control and clearance, the intensity of the antiviral immune response must']"
