What role does T-cell count play in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection?,"T-cell count appears to play a significant role in severe HAdV-55 infection, with lower T-cell counts potentially being a risk factor for severe disease. Patients with severe disease may have relatively low T-cell counts, while those who recover from severe infection tend to have higher T-cell counts. Although it is not explicitly stated, T-cell count may be used as a diagnostic marker for severe HAdV-55 infection. Furthermore, T-cell count may influence the response to antiviral therapy in HAdV-55 infection, with higher T-cell counts potentially contributing to a better response. Overall, T-cell count seems to be correlated with disease severity and may be an important factor in predicting treatment outcomes.","The T-cell count plays a crucial role in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection, as patients with severe disease may have low T-cell counts. In the study mentioned, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts, suggesting that a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe HAdV-55 infection.","['Title: Emergent severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by adenovirus type 55 in immunocompetent adults in 2013: a prospective observational study\nPassage: Recent studies have shown that the immune system plays a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV viremia and survival of the host . Chen et al. reported that, in the acute phase of HAdV-55 infection, patients with severe disease may have high levels of dendritic cells and Th17 cells .

"What is the  the rate of general transmission, even in outbreaks?","The rate of general transmission in outbreaks varies depending on the type of outbreak, with airborne transmission allowing for a more rapid spread, contact transmission requiring direct contact, and vector-borne transmission relying on a vector such as an insect. The transmission rate can also be influenced by factors such as habitat disturbance, ecological disturbances, climate change, route of transmission, and demographic factors. Additionally, asymptomatic carriers play a significant role in contributing to the overall transmission rate, as they can still transmit the virus despite not showing symptoms. However, the exact rate of general transmission is not quantified and can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances of the outbreak.","The median initial reproduction rate across all 51 outbreaks was 2 with a range of 0 to 38.

What are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution.,"The most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution are its genetic similarities with other coronaviruses, particularly bat beta-coronaviruses, with which it shares a genome sequence identity of over 96%. The phylogenetic trees of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses also support natural evolution, showing a naturally occurring pattern with a close relative in a wildlife species and no logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences. Additionally, the genome has over 1,100 nucleotide differences between the human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat RaTG13-CoV, distributed throughout the genome in a way that is consistent with natural evolution. These characteristics suggest that SARS-CoV-2 evolved through natural evolution rather than laboratory engineering. Overall, the evidence points to a natural evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2.","The most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution include the absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species. Additionally, the presence of randomly occurring mutations in naturally isolated viruses, such as bat CoV RaTG13, supports the idea that SARS-CoV-2 evolved through natural processes.","['Title: No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2\nPassage: naturally occurring pattern following the evolutionary characteristics typical of CoVs, it is highly unlikely that RaTG13 CoV is the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2.

What testing and detection are needed?,"Accurate detection requires a combination of tests, including generic detection methods such as bioluminescent measurement of ATP and mass-spectrometry, and specific methods like micro-array and immuno-assays. Additionally, characterizing the size and shape of bioaerosols, pollens, and fungal spores, as well as using sample types like bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal/tracheobronchial aspirate, and sputum, are also recommended for testing. The frequency of testing is not explicitly stated, but increasing the scale of surveillance and conducting long-term follow-up studies is important for identifying sufficient positive samples with associated clinical data. A range of detection methods are used in this field, including ELISA-array, voting schemes, and DV and CV methods. Furthermore, regulatory requirements for testing and detection must be complied with, although the specific requirements are not detailed.","The testing and detection needed for mitigation of pandemic flu include fast and efficient diagnostic tests with high specificity and sensitivity, such as a rapid PCR-based test kit that can detect the virus in less than 30 minutes.

What do neuroaminidase inhibitors target?,"Neuraminidase inhibitors target the viral surface glycoprotein of neuraminidase, specifically binding to the active site cleft of the enzyme.

What do those abnormalities sometimes culminate in?,"Those abnormalities can sometimes culminate in intellectual disability, craniofacial dysmorphologies, autism, schizophrenia, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. They can also lead to chronic health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In severe cases, life-threatening complications can occur, including cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and kidney failure, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, with mortality rates exceeding 33% in some cases. Additionally, these abnormalities can increase the risk of developing certain diseases, such as birth defects, and can affect quality of life or daily functioning. Overall, the consequences of these abnormalities can be severe and far-reaching.","Those abnormalities sometimes culminate in a range of phenotypes, such as short stature, ovarian failure, kidney malformations, hearing problems, learning difficulties, type 1 diabetes, congenital heart defects, gastrointestinal defects, and increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Title: Implications of copy number variation in people with chromosomal abnormalities: potential for greater variation in copy number state may contribute to variability of phenotype\nPassage: meiosis I or II.

What  effect the use of steroids to  suppress inflammation can have?,"The use of steroids to suppress inflammation can have several effects. In the short-term, it can lead to side effects such as hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, bruising, and osteopenia. Long-term use can result in immunosuppressive effects, increasing the risk of opportunistic infections, and can also lead to adrenal insufficiency, particularly in critically ill patients. Additionally, prolonged use can cause immunosuppression, especially with high doses or long treatment durations. Overall, steroid use for inflammation suppression can have significant consequences on the immune system and overall health.","The use of steroids to suppress inflammation can have side effects such as hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, osteopenia, and immunosuppression.

What types of cells follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung?,"Following epithelial cell activation, several types of cells are recruited to the lung to respond to infections. These include alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages, which play a crucial role in promoting viral clearance and releasing cytokines and chemokines to trigger an immune response. Additionally, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are also recruited to the lung in response to epithelial cell activation. Neutrophils are also involved in the immune response, with C5a playing a role in their recruitment to the lung following infection. Finally, dendritic cells are activated to trigger an inflammatory response and activate adaptive immune responses.","The types of cells that follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung are myeloid cells like monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and their common precursor cells, summarized as mononuclear phagocytes. These cells are crucial in driving IV clearance and play an important role in coordinating, maintaining, and balancing the phagocyte-mediated antiviral host response.","['Title: Differential Response of Primary Alveolar Type I and Type II Cells to LPS Stimulation\nPassage: The alveolar epithelium is an important component of the innate immune response of the lung. By providing an anatomic barrier that separates the organism from the external environment, the alveolar epithelium serves as a first line of defense against potential inhaled pathogens. While the cells of the innate immune system, such as alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, harbor the bulk of the responsibility for prompting an immune reaction upon encountering inhaled pathogens, the cells that comprise the alveolar epithelium have also been implicated in aiding to trigger an inflammatory response.', 'Title: Port d’Entrée for Respiratory Infections – Does the Influenza A Virus Pave the Way for Bacteria?\nPassage: Epithelial cells are the first responders to infections in the lung, followed by the tissue resident alveolar macrophages. They promote viral clearance via phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and release of cytokines and chemokines to promote immune responses . Respiratory viruses like IAV are able to induce suppression and killing of the resident alveolar macrophages .

During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection .

What is R0?,"R0, or the basic reproduction number, is a fundamental concept in epidemiology that represents the average number of infections each case causes in a fully susceptible population without any control measures. It is calculated as the number of infections caused by a single case in a population that is completely susceptible to the disease. A good R0 value in terms of disease control is typically less than 1, indicating that the disease will not spread. R0 is an important metric in understanding the transmission of diseases and is related to herd immunity, with higher R0 values indicating a lower threshold for herd immunity. Overall, R0 provides valuable insights into the contagiousness and spread of diseases.","R0, or the basic reproduction number, is a measure of the transmissibility of a strain in the population and represents the average number of infections each case causes.

"Why is the determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission, an urgent priority?","The determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission is an urgent priority because it informs public health policy and intervention strategies, enabling prompt and accurate measures to prevent or delay local transmission and clusters. Delayed or inadequate determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission can lead to delayed outbreak control and pandemic preparedness, resulting in a larger outbreak size and increased mortality. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals can unknowingly transmit the virus to others, contributing to the spread of infectious diseases, and detecting and tracking these cases is crucial to controlling outbreaks. The challenges in detecting and tracking asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases, such as practical geographical and logistic constraints, limited capacity and resources, and lack of data retrieval systems, further emphasize the need for urgent attention to this issue.","The determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission is an urgent priority because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control.

Therefore, hantaviruses may have evolved mechanisms of manipulating target genes, which establishes persistence when induced.']"
Where do the respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate?,"Respiratory viruses primarily infect airway epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, which can occur in both the upper and lower respiratory airways. The specific location of initial infection may vary depending on the type of virus and the individual. Respiratory viruses can replicate in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, although some viruses, such as influenza, have an affinity for infecting the lower respiratory tract. Influenza virus replication in the lower respiratory tract may be ongoing and prolonged after the virus is no longer detectable in the upper respiratory tract.",The respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate in the airway epithelial cells.,"['Title: Respiratory Viral Infections in Exacerbation of Chronic Airway Inflammatory Diseases: Novel Mechanisms and Insights From the Upper Airway Epithelium\nPassage: Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation', 'Title: Non-specific Effect of Vaccines: Immediate Protection against Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection by a Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine\nPassage: Respiratory viral infections, caused by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus , human parainfluenza viruses , and coronaviruses, remain a global public health concern . WHO has acknowledged the magnitude of this problem and has highlighted the need for research focused on the prevention of respiratory viral infections. However, except for influenza virus, there are no authorized vaccines available for the prevention of emerging/re-emerging respiratory viral infections .

When did Hantavirus infections became a concern in the Americas?,"Hantavirus infections became a concern in the Americas in 1993, when an outbreak of acute respiratory distress occurred in the Four Corners area. This outbreak led to the description of a new disease, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), and the discovery of the Sin Nombre virus.

Why is the phage ab excellent model system for directed protein evolution?,"The phage is an excellent model system for directed protein evolution due to its unique characteristics, which facilitate the selection of desired protein traits. Its tolerance of genetic modifications allows for the display of biomolecules on the virion surface and the generation of large libraries of variant proteins through random or site-directed mutagenesis. The phage's life cycle enables rapid evolution of proteins with desired properties through iterative cycles of panning and amplification. Additionally, the small size and simple composition of phage genomes simplify the process of directed evolution, allowing for easy manipulation, rapid replication, and the introduction of genetic modifications. Overall, the phage's properties make it an ideal system for directed protein evolution, enabling the selection of high-affinity binders and the rapid evolution of proteins with desired properties.","The phage is an excellent model system for directed protein evolution because their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes, and ease of manipulation make them ideal for experimental evolution and for displaying biomolecules on the virion surface for protein engineering purposes.","['Title: Beyond phage display: non-traditional applications of the filamentous bacteriophage as a vaccine carrier, therapeutic biologic, and bioconjugation scaffold\nPassage: Because of their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes and ease of manipulation, various filamentous and non-filamentous bacteriophages have been used as models of experimental evolution .

What was the failure of rAd5 vaccine for inducing HIV-1 specific T cell response?,"The rAd5 vaccine failed to induce a robust HIV-1 specific T cell response due to pre-existing immunity against the vaccine carrier, adenovirus 5 (Ad5). This pre-existing immunity led to the induction of neutralizing antibodies that reduced the number of transduced cells, thereby limiting the immune response. As a result, the vaccine was unable to induce potent HIV-1-specific T-cell responses, particularly CD8+ T-cell responses, which were expected to be a key outcome of the vaccine. The failure of the rAd5 vaccine highlights the importance of considering pre-existing immunity when designing vaccine strategies. Alternative adenovirus serotypes have since been explored to avoid this issue.","The failure of the rAd5 vaccine for inducing HIV-1 specific T cell response was thought to be due to the insufficient magnitude, functionality, or breadth of the vaccine-induced cellular immune responses, as well as the presence of preexisting immunity against the vector.","['Title: Viral vector-based influenza vaccines\nPassage: one single study, cross-reactive cellular immune responses against A viruses were observed after vaccination with a NDV-H5 construct. 168 The immunogenicity of recombinant NDV expressing the HA and NA genes of influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 was tested in non-human primates.

Presumably this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses.

What can happen  in response to the infection such as neutrophils?,"In response to infection, neutrophils can internalize and kill microbes, perform tissue debridement, and attract monocytes to initiate healing. They can also recognize pathogens through pattern recognition receptors, inducing the production of interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, neutrophils can eliminate pathogens through phagocytosis and collaborate with other immune cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, to promote chemotaxis and transmigration to the site of infection. However, if their recruitment and activation become dysregulated, neutrophils can contribute to inflammation and tissue injury, leading to tissue debridement and cell death. Overall, neutrophils play a crucial role in the immune response to infection, but their dysregulation can have negative consequences.","In response to infection, neutrophils can help to resolve tissue damage, form a defense against bacteria through phagocytosis and release of antimicrobial molecules, but they can also contribute to collateral organ damage of the host when released into tissues and enhance susceptibility to post-traumatic infections. Additionally, disrupted protective barriers in combination with the presence of immunosuppressive and less responsive neutrophils can further enhance the susceptibility to post-traumatic infections.","['Title: Neutrophil heterogeneity and its role in infectious complications after severe trauma\nPassage: After trauma, the injury induces an immediate innate immune response to protect disrupted barriers from pathogens, to clear tissue damage, and to induce healing . Many humoral and cellular mediators including leukocytes, the coagulation, and complement cascades strictly regulate these processes. However, sometimes these processes become dysregulated and severe immune mediated complications can occur .

What is the premise for apathogenic forms to  blunt any pathological response in the host?,"Based on the provided Q+A pairs, it appears that the premise for apathogenic forms to blunt any pathological response in the host is not explicitly stated in the context. However, it can be inferred that apathogenic forms have evolved mechanisms to evade host immune responses, modulate the host's immune system, and interact with host cells to prevent a pathological response. One possible underlying mechanism involves adaptations that enhance immune function, particularly tolerance responses that aid host survival without resulting in parasite clearance. Despite the lack of specific examples in the provided context, it is likely that apathogenic forms have developed strategies to mitigate pathological responses in hosts, but further information is needed to fully understand these mechanisms.",The premise for apathogenic forms to blunt any pathological response in the host is that they tend to induce an earlier innate response that would render it more likely that the virus would.,"['Title: Respiratory Viral Infections in Exacerbation of Chronic Airway Inflammatory Diseases: Novel Mechanisms and Insights From the Upper Airway Epithelium\nPassage: On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV and certain CoV , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance.

What is the function of neuroaminidase in the influenza virus?,"Neuraminidase (NA) plays a crucial role in the influenza virus life cycle, mediating the release of progeny virus from infected host cells. It facilitates the spread of the virus between host cells by promoting virus budding and movement towards endocytosis regions, allowing the virus to infect new cells. NA also contributes to the virulence of influenza virus infections by enabling the virus to efficiently infect and replicate within host cells. Inhibiting NA activity suppresses virus infection, highlighting its importance in the virus's life cycle. Overall, NA is essential for the successful replication and transmission of the influenza virus.",Neuroaminidase (NA) in the influenza virus helps in the spreading of the virus by enabling progeny virus to be cleaved from its receptor and spread to other cells.

The immunization with adenovirus vector encoding NP induced both cellular and antibody responses. It has been shown recently that influenza virus-infected cells can be eliminated by anti-M2e IgG-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis since these cells express M2 on their surface after infection .

The initial sensing of an invading virus by pattern recognition receptors of the host innate immune system induces the production of interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines as a part of the early host antiviral response phase. Afterwards, both the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and B-cell production of neutralizing antibodies ultimately mounts an effective and specific antiviral response for optimal viral clearance.

Which is the source animal for the MERS-COV?,"The source animal for MERS-CoV is the dromedary camel. Dromedary camels are the primary reservoir of MERS-CoV, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in them.

Why do low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1?,"Low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 by allowing the virus to bind to the CCR5 receptor more easily, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier. Normally, DC-SIGNR acts as a barrier to HIV-1 transmission by binding to the virus and preventing it from binding to the CCR5 receptor. However, reduced expression of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells favors HIV-1 binding to CCR5, increasing the likelihood of in utero transmission of HIV-1. This suggests that low levels of DC-SIGNR create an environment that enables HIV-1 to cross the placental barrier more easily, increasing the risk of MTCT.","Low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1 because reduced expression of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells might favor HIV-1 binding to the CCR5 receptor instead of the DC-SIGNR receptor, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier.

Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?,"MA15 is likely to be highly attenuated to replicate in human cells due to its six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. These mutations are different from the ""human-adapting"" mutations at residues 627 and 701 of the PB2 protein, suggesting that MA15 has evolved to replicate efficiently in mice rather than humans. As a result, its replication in human cells or patients is likely to be impaired. Additionally, the host immune response to MA15 infection may also contribute to its attenuation in human cells, although the exact mechanisms of this difference are not specified. Overall, MA15's mouse adaptation is likely to be the primary reason for its attenuation in human cells.","The basis for the host-restriction of MVA, which is important to fully understand its attenuation, remains unknown. The large number of deletions, truncations, and mutations that occurred during the long passage history of MVA in CEF severely complicates efforts to determine those changes important for its host-range defect.

What other tests should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology?,"In addition to rapid antigen detection tests, molecular diagnostic tests such as molecular testing and nested PCR should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology. These tests have better sensitivity and specificity compared to serological tests and can detect the virus in anal swabs or blood even when oral swabs detection is negative. Viral IgM and IgG serological tests can also be used to confirm an infection, considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection. Furthermore, environmental sampling tests could potentially be explored for detecting 2019-nCOV in high-risk settings, although more information is needed to determine their effectiveness. Overall, a combination of these tests can provide a more comprehensive approach to detecting and tracking 2019-nCOV infections.","Other tests that should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology include serum antibody titers for confirmation of infection or evidence of immunity, polymerase chain reaction assays conducted on samples from a patient's upper and lower respiratory tracts, and serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits which are likely to be developed in the near future.","['Title: Molecular and serological investigation of 2019-nCoV infected patients: implication of multiple shedding routes\nPassage: through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people.

How does transmission differ between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV?,"Transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV differs in several ways. While the primary modes of transmission are not explicitly stated, SARS-CoV spreads more rapidly between hosts, whereas MERS-CoV has been more easily contained. Animal hosts, such as bats and camels, play a role in the transmission of both viruses, hosting them and potentially transmitting them to humans. Additionally, certain populations are more susceptible to transmission, with MERS-CoV having a higher association with fatal cases in older males with underlying comorbidities.","Transmission of SARS-CoV is more rapid between hosts, while MERS-CoV transmission is defined as sporadic, intra-familial, often healthcare associated, inefficient and requiring close and prolonged contact.

What leads to oxidative stress in the body?,"Oxidative stress in the body is primarily caused by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) as a result of metabolic processes. A poor diet, lacking essential micronutrients and high in certain fatty acids, can disrupt cellular processes and lead to oxidative stress. Environmental toxins also play a role by producing reactive species that can disrupt cellular signaling pathways and affect iron metabolism. Additionally, chronic inflammation, often accompanied by viral infections, can increase oxidative stress, creating a cycle of inflammation and oxidative stress. Lifestyle factors such as lack of sleep and exercise can further contribute to oxidative stress, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.","Oxidative stress in the body can be caused by a wide range of reactive species produced as a result of the metabolic process, including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. This can be magnified by the production of ROS from various cellular organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and peroxisomes.

What is theorized regarding transmission?,"According to theoretical models, transmission can occur through two modes: contact transmission and aerosol transmission. The mechanism of transmission is explained through various approaches, including the use of neutral genetic markers, population genetic methods, and mathematical models that take into account factors such as the route of transmission, allele frequencies, and genetic drift. Environmental factors, such as changing ecosystems and land-use changes, play a significant role in disease emergence and transmission by increasing the intensity and frequency of contact between host species. Theoretical models, such as the improved pairwise model and the Reservoir-People transmission network model, can predict the rate of transmission and estimate specific transmission parameters. To prevent or reduce transmission, theorists suggest isolating infected hosts, contact tracing in clustered populations, and identifying infected hosts quickly and thoroughly.","The passages discuss different aspects of viral transmission and the methods used to analyze and understand transmission dynamics. It is theorized that transmission is an important process underlying infectious disease dynamics, and different approaches are used to study and analyze transmission patterns in various populations.

How can DNA arise chemically from RNA?,"According to the provided context, DNA can arise from RNA chemically through the formation of deoxyribozymes from ribonucleotides. This process allows RNA nucleotides to be linked together to form a DNA-like backbone, effectively converting RNA into DNA. While the exact mechanism in a primordial soup is not specified, it is clear that RNA can serve as a template for DNA synthesis through some chemical mechanism. This conversion can occur without the key protein enzyme, reverse transcriptase, suggesting that DNA can arise from RNA through abiotic means.","DNA can arise from RNA chemically without the key protein enzyme, the reverse transcriptase.
