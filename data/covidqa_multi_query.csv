What testing and detection are needed?,"Based on the provided passages, it appears that various testing and detection methods are needed for different purposes. For instance, molecular diagnostic techniques such as real-time PCR, ELISA-array, and digital PCR are required for detecting and identifying viral pathogens like influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Additionally, innovative approaches like bioluminescent measurement of ATP, mass-spectrometry, micro-array, and immuno-assays are necessary for detecting and characterizing bioaerosols, pollens, and fungal spores in outdoor environments. Furthermore, computer-aided detection systems are needed for analyzing digital chest radiographs to identify pathologies. Overall, a range of detection methods is required to accurately identify and quantify different types of pathogens and diseases.","The testing and detection needed for mitigation of pandemic flu include fast and efficient diagnostic tests with high specificity and sensitivity, such as a rapid PCR-based test kit that can detect the virus in less than 30 minutes. This type of testing is necessary for identifying potential flu carriers before they become symptomatic and for implementing intervention policies and containment measures. Additionally, accurate estimation of the number of infections and underreporting, as well as systematic and country-specific changes in testing, is also needed for effective pandemic mitigation.","['Title: Outdoor environments and human pathogens in air\nPassage: Detection and identification of pathogens has changed since the development of different molecular methods and innovative approaches other than culture methods .

What  effect the use of steroids to  suppress inflammation can have?,"According to the passages, the use of corticosteroids to suppress inflammation can have an immunosuppressive effect, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections. This immunosuppressive effect can lead to impaired bacterial immune response, allowing opportunistic pathogens to replace normal flora and alter inflammatory profiles. As a result, it can lead to more severe and frequent acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Additionally, corticosteroids can also have other physiological effects, such as hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, bruising, and osteopenia.","The use of steroids to suppress inflammation can have side effects such as hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, osteopenia, and immunosuppression.

As well as these side effects, corticosteroids have strong immunosuppressive effects, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections, despite their potential effect in controlling excessive inflammatory response. The immunosuppressant effect of corticosteroids is related to dose and treatment duration.

What types of cells follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung?,"According to the passage, tissue resident alveolar macrophages follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung. These macrophages promote viral clearance via phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and release of cytokines and chemokines to promote immune responses.","The types of cells that follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung are myeloid cells like monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and their common precursor cells, summarized as mononuclear phagocytes. These cells are crucial in driving IV clearance and play an important role in coordinating, maintaining, and balancing the phagocyte-mediated antiviral host response.","['Title: Differential Response of Primary Alveolar Type I and Type II Cells to LPS Stimulation\nPassage: The alveolar epithelium is an important component of the innate immune response of the lung. By providing an anatomic barrier that separates the organism from the external environment, the alveolar epithelium serves as a first line of defense against potential inhaled pathogens. While the cells of the innate immune system, such as alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, harbor the bulk of the responsibility for prompting an immune reaction upon encountering inhaled pathogens, the cells that comprise the alveolar epithelium have also been implicated in aiding to trigger an inflammatory response.', 'Title: Port d’Entrée for Respiratory Infections – Does the Influenza A Virus Pave the Way for Bacteria?\nPassage: Epithelial cells are the first responders to infections in the lung, followed by the tissue resident alveolar macrophages. They promote viral clearance via phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and release of cytokines and chemokines to promote immune responses . Respiratory viruses like IAV are able to induce suppression and killing of the resident alveolar macrophages . These cells are usually replaced by differentiation of recruited blood derived monocytes into macrophages of different polarization patterns.

"Why is the determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission, an urgent priority?","The determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission is an urgent priority because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control. If pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring, it would mean that individuals can spread the virus before showing symptoms, which would significantly impact the effectiveness of current control measures.

The newly recognized disease, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, HCPS , was linked to infection by the newly-discovered Sin Nombre virus , and the rodent Peromyscus maniculatus was identified as the reservoir .

In our cohort, we found that severe HAdV-55 infection could cause a rapid progression of respiratory failure, with a very high failure rate for NPPV and IMV. This failure rate may be a result of the large area of consolidation that induced a severe shunt in the lung, which may lead to lack of response to positive pressure ventilation.

What is the function of neuroaminidase in the influenza virus?,"According to the passage, neuraminidase (NA) is thought to mediate progeny virus budding from host cells, and it also plays a role in the movement of virus particles toward endocytosis regions. NA inhibitors, such as zanamivir, can suppress virus infection and block virus crawling and gliding motions on fetuin-coated surfaces, resulting in the immobilization of virus particles. Additionally, NA is involved in the budding of progeny viruses from host cells. Overall, NA appears to play a crucial role in the infection process of influenza viruses.",Neuroaminidase (NA) in the influenza virus helps in the spreading of the virus by enabling progeny virus to be cleaved from its receptor and spread to other cells. It also facilitates the release of newly formed virus particles from infected cells by cleaving the glycosidic linkage between the neuraminic acid receptor on the host-cell surface and the glycoproteins of the virion progeny.,"['Title: Influenza A virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase act as novel motile machinery\nPassage: Role of NA in virus movement.

Why do low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1?,"According to the passage, low levels of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells may enhance Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 by favouring HIV-1 binding to the CCR5 receptor instead of DC-SIGNR, thereby facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier. This is because DC-SIGNR normally acts as a receptor that can bind to HIV-1, preventing it from binding to the CCR5 receptor and entering the cell. With reduced DC-SIGNR expression, HIV-1 is more likely to bind to CCR5 and infect the cell, increasing the risk of MTCT.","Low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1 because reduced expression of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells might favor HIV-1 binding to the CCR5 receptor instead of the DC-SIGNR receptor, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier. This results in intrauterine transmission of HIV-1.","['Title: Functional Genetic Variants in DC-SIGNR Are Associated with Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV-1\nPassage: on endothelial cells compromises BBB integrity and enhances monocytes adhesion and transmigration across the BBB . It is thus possible that reduced expression of DC-SIGNR, particularly the membranebound isoforms, on placental capillary endothelial cells might favour HIV-1 binding to CCR5 receptor, instead of DC-SIGNR receptor, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier resulting in IU transmission of HIV-1.', 'Title: Functional Genetic Variants in DC-SIGNR Are Associated with Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV-1\nPassage: Text: Without specific interventions, the rate of HIV-1 mother-tochild transmission is approximately 15-45% . UNAIDS estimates that last year alone, more than 400,000 children were infected worldwide, mostly through MTCT and 90% of them lived in sub-Saharan Africa. In the most heavilyaffected countries, such as Zimbabwe, HIV-1 is responsible for one third of all deaths among children under the age of five.

Individuals homozygous for a 32 base pair deletion in CCR5 that disrupts its expression are largely HIV-1 resistant . X4-using viruses tend to arise later in infection in some, but not all, individuals, and are associated with more rapid progression to AIDS.

Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?,"The question is not directly related to the provided passages. However, based on the context of the passages, it can be inferred that MA15 is likely to be highly attenuated to replicate in human cells because it is an avian polymerase, and the passage mentions that avian polymerase has poor activity in mammalian cells due to differences in host factors, such as ANP32A, between flighted birds and mammals. This suggests that MA15 may not be well-suited to replicate in human cells, leading to attenuation.","The basis for the host-restriction of MVA, which is important to fully understand its attenuation, remains unknown. The large number of deletions, truncations, and mutations that occurred during the long passage history of MVA in CEF severely complicates efforts to determine those changes important for its host-range defect. Additionally, the MVA genome revealed six major deletions compared to the parent virus, and the consequent inability to efficiently produce infectious virus in most mammalian cells, suggesting that MA15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells.","['Title: Viral factors in influenza pandemic risk assessment\nPassage: Ultimately, it would be valuable to develop a simple screen to assess the ability of a viral polymerase to support replication and transmission in humans.

What other tests should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology?,"According to the passage, serology, specifically viral IgM and IgG serological tests, should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology, as the results from oral swabs detection are unreliable. This is because viral antibodies were found in nearly all patients, indicating that serology could be a more accurate method for diagnosis. Additionally, anal swab tests could also be considered, as the virus may be present in anal swabs even when oral swabs are negative.","Other tests that should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology include serum antibody titers for confirmation of infection or evidence of immunity, polymerase chain reaction assays conducted on samples from a patient's upper and lower respiratory tracts, and serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits which are likely to be developed in the near future.","['Title: Molecular and serological investigation of 2019-nCoV infected patients: implication of multiple shedding routes\nPassage: Like SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV induced pneumonia through respiratory tract by clinical observation.

In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients, intestinal infection was observed at later stages of infection . However, patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease.

In contrast, we found viral antibodies in near all patients, indicating serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology. A possible shift from oral positive during early infection to anal swab positive during late infection can be observed.

Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination .', 'Title: Consequences of delays and imperfect implementation of isolation in epidemic control\nPassage: Isolation of infected hosts disconnects the infection pathway for diseases that are transmitted human-to-human and should, in principle, be 100% effective, yet it has not always stopped incipient outbreaks from burgeoning into full-blown epidemics. In this paper we called attention to the fact that a major reason may be ""too little, too late"", meaning the identification of infected hosts may not be sufficiently thorough and are too often subject to delays. We sought a mathematical model that could offer guidance on the response needed to contain an outbreak, as well as predict the consequences when one falls short. Our aim']"
How does transmission differ between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV?,"According to the passages, SARS-CoV spreads more rapidly between hosts, while MERS-CoV has been more easily contained. However, in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea, MERS-CoV had a high transmissibility with an R0 of 2.5-7.2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 might have a higher transmissibility in Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS transmitted in the Republic of Korea. Overall, the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV differ in terms of their speed and ease of spread between hosts.","Transmission of SARS-CoV is more rapid between hosts, while MERS-CoV transmission is defined as sporadic, intra-familial, often healthcare associated, inefficient and requiring close and prolonged contact. Additionally, MERS-CoV has been more easily contained compared to SARS-CoV.","['Title: Host resilience to emerging coronaviruses\nPassage: Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are typified by a rapid progression to ARDS, however, there are some distinct differences in the infectivity and pathogenicity. The two viruses have different receptors leading to different cellular tropism, and SARS-CoV is more ubiquitous in the cell type and species it can infect. SARS-CoV uses the ACE2 receptor to gain entry to cells, while MERS-CoV uses the ectopeptidase DPP4 . Unlike SARS-CoV infection, which causes primarily a severe respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV infection can also lead to kidney failure .

What leads to oxidative stress in the body?,"According to the passage, a wide range of reactive species (RS) is produced as a result of the metabolic process in the body, leading to oxidative stress. These RS can be reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species. Previously, RS were only considered to be toxic compounds, but recent studies have highlighted their involvement in complex cellular signaling pathways and have improved their importance in several biological systems.","Oxidative stress in the body can be caused by a wide range of reactive species produced as a result of the metabolic process, including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. This can be magnified by the production of ROS from various cellular organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and peroxisomes. Additionally, factors such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, leptin, angiotensin II, and virus-induced cytokines can also contribute to oxidative stress in the body.","['Title: Oxidative Stress in Poultry: Lessons from the Viral Infections\nPassage: The theory of oxidative stress existed since the last 60 years.

What is theorized regarding transmission?,"According to the passages, it is theorized that the transmission bottleneck is dependent upon the route of transmission, whether by contact or aerosol transmission. The size of the transmission bottleneck can be analyzed using population genetic methods. The process of within-host growth imposes uncertainty upon allele frequencies, which can be incorporated into models of genetic drift to characterize the bottleneck. Additionally, the transmissibility of a novel coronavirus can be simulated using a transmission network model, and the R0 value can be calculated to assess transmissibility. Furthermore, human networks within a low-resource population have the potential to transmit respiratory infectious diseases.","The passages discuss different aspects of viral transmission and the methods used to analyze and understand transmission dynamics.

How can DNA arise chemically from RNA?,"According to the passage, DNA can arise chemically from RNA without the key protein enzyme, the reverse transcriptase, through the formation of deoxyribozymes from ribonucleotides. This means that RNA can be converted into DNA through a chemical process, without the need for an enzyme to facilitate the reaction. This process suggests that DNA can emerge from RNA through a spontaneous chemical reaction, rather than relying on an enzyme to catalyze the conversion.","DNA can arise from RNA chemically without the key protein enzyme, the reverse transcriptase. RNA molecules can become longer through heat flow across an open pore in submerged rocks, which concentrates replicating oligonucleotides from a constant feeding flow and selection for longer strands.","['Title: Viruses and Evolution – Viruses First?
