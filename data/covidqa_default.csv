What role does T-cell count play in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection?,"According to the passage, a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection. The study found that three out of five patients with severe infection had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted, suggesting that they may have been relatively immunocompromised. In contrast, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. This suggests that T-cell count plays a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV viremia and survival of the host.","The T-cell count plays a crucial role in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection, as patients with severe disease may have low T-cell counts.

What  effect the use of steroids to  suppress inflammation can have?,"According to the passages, the use of corticosteroids to suppress inflammation can have an immunosuppressive effect, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections. This immunosuppressive effect can lead to impaired bacterial immune response, making the body more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens and altering the inflammatory profiles. Additionally, corticosteroids can also lead to the growth of pathogenic bacteria, replacing the normal flora and causing more severe and frequent acute exacerbations.","The use of steroids to suppress inflammation can have side effects such as hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, osteopenia, and immunosuppression. However, it may also reduce the risk for side effects if used for a short period.","['Title: New aspects in the management of pneumonia\nPassage: The main side effects associated with corticosteroids, especially with prolonged use, are hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, brushing, and osteopenia . As well as these side effects, corticosteroids have strong immunosuppressive effects, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections, despite their potential effect in controlling excessive inflammatory response. The immunosuppressant effect of corticosteroids is related to dose and treatment duration. For example, the use of 40 mg of prednisolone per day for more than 1 week or 20 mg prednisolone or equivalent per day for a month can produce immunosuppression.

In our cohort, we found that severe HAdV-55 infection could cause a rapid progression of respiratory failure, with a very high failure rate for NPPV and IMV. This failure rate may be a result of the large area of consolidation that induced a severe shunt in the lung, which may lead to lack of response to positive pressure ventilation. For patients with severe ARDS, ECMO should be considered a better choice for oxygenation.', 'Title: Emergent severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by adenovirus type 55 in immunocompetent adults in 2013: a prospective observational study\nPassage: 1 × 10 in one patient.

Why is the phage ab excellent model system for directed protein evolution?,"The filamentous phage is an excellent model system for directed protein evolution due to its large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes, and ease of manipulation. Additionally, its unique tolerance of genetic modifications allows biomolecules to be displayed on the virion surface, making it an ideal platform for protein engineering and directed protein evolution. This enables the generation of libraries of variant proteins, such as antibody fragments, which can be selected and evolved through multiple rounds of mutation and selection. The phage's ability to display proteins on its surface also allows for the connection of genetic information with protein function, facilitating the study of protein-protein interactions. Overall, the phage's characteristics make it an ideal system for directed protein evolution and protein engineering.","The phage is an excellent model system for directed protein evolution because their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes, and ease of manipulation make them ideal for experimental evolution and for displaying biomolecules on the virion surface for protein engineering purposes.","['Title: Beyond phage display: non-traditional applications of the filamentous bacteriophage as a vaccine carrier, therapeutic biologic, and bioconjugation scaffold\nPassage: Because of their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes and ease of manipulation, various filamentous and non-filamentous bacteriophages have been used as models of experimental evolution .

What is the function of neuroaminidase in the influenza virus?,"According to the passages, the function of neuraminidase (NA) in the influenza virus is to mediate progeny virus budding from host cells. Additionally, NA is involved in the movement of virus particles towards endocytosis regions, as evidenced by the fact that NA inhibitors, such as zanamivir, can block virus crawling and gliding motions. NA is also a target for drug design, and its inhibitors, such as zanamivir and oseltamivir, can inhibit the spread of influenza viral progeny by binding to the viral surface glycoprotein of neuraminidase.",Neuroaminidase (NA) in the influenza virus helps in the spreading of the virus by enabling progeny virus to be cleaved from its receptor and spread to other cells. It also facilitates the release of newly formed virus particles from infected cells by cleaving the glycosidic linkage between the neuraminic acid receptor on the host-cell surface and the glycoproteins of the virion progeny.,"['Title: Influenza A virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase act as novel motile machinery\nPassage: Role of NA in virus movement.

Which bacteial delivery vectors have gained favor for vaccines?,"Based on the provided passages, it appears that adenovirus vectors, baculovirus vectors, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors have gained favor for vaccines. These vectors have been shown to be effective in inducing protective immunity against various diseases, including influenza and Ebola.

Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?,"There is no mention of MA15 in the provided passages, so it's not possible to determine why it might be highly attenuated to replicate in human cells. The passages discuss various aspects of viral replication, mutation rates, and host-virus interactions, but MA15 is not mentioned.","The basis for the host-restriction of MVA, which is important to fully understand its attenuation, remains unknown. The large number of deletions, truncations, and mutations that occurred during the long passage history of MVA in CEF severely complicates efforts to determine those changes important for its host-range defect.

Analyses of transmission have employed different approaches, exploiting the observation or non-observation of variant alleles or using changes in allele frequencies to characterise the bottleneck under a model of genetic drift . A recent publication improved this latter model, incorporating the uncertainty imposed upon allele frequencies by the process of within-host growth .', 'Title: Early real-time estimation of the basic reproduction number of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases in a community with heterogeneous contact pattern: Using data from Hong Kong 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza as an illustrative example\nPassage: Thus ψðtÞ ¼ e Àl r t and ðtÞ ¼ l r e Àl r t are probability function that the time for an individual to be removed at time t and its corresponding probability density function respectively.

How can DNA arise chemically from RNA?,"According to the passage, DNA can arise chemically from RNA through the formation of deoxyribozymes from ribonucleotides, without the need for the key protein enzyme reverse transcriptase.","DNA can arise from RNA chemically without the key protein enzyme, the reverse transcriptase. RNA molecules can become longer through heat flow across an open pore in submerged rocks, which concentrates replicating oligonucleotides from a constant feeding flow and selection for longer strands.","['Title: Viruses and Evolution – Viruses First?

Pol I transcribes rDNA to produce the 47S rRNA, which is the precursor of the mature 28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNAs. Together with the 5S rRNA transcribed by Pol III in the nucleoplasm, these rRNAs form the nucleic acid backbone of the ribosome. The other major components of the ribosome are the~78 ribosomal proteins , whose genes are transcribed by Pol II, and are assembled with the rRNAs to form functional ribosomes', 'Title: Perturbations at the ribosomal genes loci are at the centre of cellular dysfunction and human disease\nPassage: In addition to RNA Polymerase I, optimal rRNA gene transcription requires a number of accessory factors that facilitate Pol I recruitment, initiation, promoter escape, elongation, termination and re-initiation . Pol I transcription begins with the formation of the preinitiation complex by the upstream binding factor and the TBP-containing complex selectively factor at the rDNA promoter. SL-1 confers promoter sequence specificity by recognizing the core promoter element and it promotes a stable interaction between UBF and the rDNA promoter . In turn, UBF binds the upstream and core promoter elements as a dimer, possibly looping the intervening DNA into a nucleosome']"
