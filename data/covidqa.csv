What role does T-cell count play in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection?,"According to the study, a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection. Three out of five patients with severe infection had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted, suggesting that they may have been relatively immunocompromised. In contrast, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. This suggests that T-cell count plays a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV-55 viremia and survival of the host.","The T-cell count plays a crucial role in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection, as patients with severe disease may have low T-cell counts.

What are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution.,"The most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution are the absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and the lack of a close relative in a wildlife species.

What  effect the use of steroids to  suppress inflammation can have?,"The use of corticosteroids to suppress inflammation can have an immunosuppressive effect, which raises concerns regarding their use in acute infections. This immunosuppressive effect can lead to impaired bacterial immune response, making it easier for opportunistic pathogens to replace normal flora and alter the inflammatory profiles. This can result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between viruses and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the destabilization of the airway environment can lead to the growth of pathogenic bacteria, dispersing upper airway commensals into the lower airway, and causing further inflammation and alteration of the airway microbiome.","The use of steroids to suppress inflammation can have side effects such as hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, osteopenia, and immunosuppression. However, it may also reduce the risk for side effects if used for a short period.","['Title: New aspects in the management of pneumonia\nPassage: The main side effects associated with corticosteroids, especially with prolonged use, are hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, brushing, and osteopenia . As well as these side effects, corticosteroids have strong immunosuppressive effects, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections, despite their potential effect in controlling excessive inflammatory response. The immunosuppressant effect of corticosteroids is related to dose and treatment duration. For example, the use of 40 mg of prednisolone per day for more than 1 week or 20 mg prednisolone or equivalent per day for a month can produce immunosuppression.

What types of cells follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung?,"Tissue resident alveolar macrophages follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung. These macrophages promote viral clearance via phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and release of cytokines and chemokines to promote immune responses. However, in some cases, such as with Influenza A Virus (IAV) infections, the resident alveolar macrophages can be suppressed or killed, leading to a delay in pathogen clearance. In such cases, recruited blood-derived monocytes differentiate into macrophages of different polarization patterns to replace the resident alveolar macrophages.","The types of cells that follow epithelial cells in the immune response to infections in the lung are myeloid cells like monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and their common precursor cells, summarized as mononuclear phagocytes. These cells are crucial in driving IV clearance and play an important role in coordinating, maintaining, and balancing the phagocyte-mediated antiviral host response.","['Title: Differential Response of Primary Alveolar Type I and Type II Cells to LPS Stimulation\nPassage: The alveolar epithelium is an important component of the innate immune response of the lung. By providing an anatomic barrier that separates the organism from the external environment, the alveolar epithelium serves as a first line of defense against potential inhaled pathogens.

The newly recognized disease, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, HCPS , was linked to infection by the newly-discovered Sin Nombre virus , and the rodent Peromyscus maniculatus was identified as the reservoir . However, hantavirus infections have a much longer history. A review of ancient Chinese writings, dating back to approximately 960 AD, revealed descriptions closely resembling hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome , the syndrome caused by Old World hantaviruses . During the twentieth century,', 'Title: Hantaviruses in the Americas and Their Role as Emerging Pathogens\nPassage: ratios, for the most common viral serotypes, between 30% and 40%. Habitat disturbance and larger-scale ecological disturbances, perhaps including climate change, are among the factors that may have increased the human caseload of HCPS between 1993 and the present. We consider here the features that influence the structure of host population dynamics that may lead to viral outbreaks, as well as the macromolecular determinants of hantaviruses that have been regarded as having potential contribution to pathogenicity.', 'Title: Hantaviruses in the Americas and Their Role as Emerging Pathogens\nPassage: Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression .

In our cohort, we found that severe HAdV-55 infection could cause a rapid progression of respiratory failure, with a very high failure rate for NPPV and IMV. This failure rate may be a result of the large area of consolidation that induced a severe shunt in the lung, which may lead to lack of response to positive pressure ventilation. For patients with severe ARDS, ECMO should be considered a better choice for oxygenation.', 'Title: Emergent severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by adenovirus type 55 in immunocompetent adults in 2013: a prospective observational study\nPassage: 1 × 10 in one patient.

Why do low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1?,"Low levels of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells may enhance Mother to Child Transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 by favoring HIV-1 binding to the CCR5 receptor instead of DC-SIGNR.

Essentially, reduced expression of DC-SIGNR compromises the placental barrier's integrity, allowing HIV-1-infected cells to cross over and infect the fetus. This suggests that DC-SIGNR plays a protective role in preventing MTCT of HIV-1.","Low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1 because reduced expression of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells might favor HIV-1 binding to the CCR5 receptor instead of the DC-SIGNR receptor, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier.

Individuals homozygous for a 32 base pair deletion in CCR5 that disrupts its expression are largely HIV-1 resistant . X4-using viruses tend to arise later in infection in some, but not all, individuals, and are associated with more rapid progression to AIDS.

Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?,"There is no information in the provided passages about MA15. However, based on the information about avian polymerase in passage 3, it can be inferred that if a virus has a polymerase that is adapted to avian cells, it may be attenuated in human cells due to differences in host factors. This is because the passage mentions that the avian polymerase has poor activity in mammalian cells due to differences in the host factor ANP32A.","The basis for the host-restriction of MVA, which is important to fully understand its attenuation, remains unknown. The large number of deletions, truncations, and mutations that occurred during the long passage history of MVA in CEF severely complicates efforts to determine those changes important for its host-range defect.

How may the responses be different in a chronically inflamed airway?,"In a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration. This can lead to the exacerbation of the condition, rather than the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection seen in a healthy airway. The impaired responses may result in the dysregulation of inflammation, which can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modifications. This can lead to a more severe and prolonged inflammatory response, ultimately exacerbating the chronic airway inflammatory disease.","In a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in exacerbation.

What causes tuberculosis?,"Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is often spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing droplets that contain the bacteria. In some cases, tuberculosis can also be caused by other mycobacteria, but M. tuberculosis is the most common cause. The bacteria can infect various parts of the body, but the lungs are the most commonly affected, leading to pulmonary tuberculosis.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. africanum, M. canettii, M. microtti, and M. bovis, are the causes of tuberculosis.","['Title: Key mechanisms governing resolution of lung inflammation\nPassage: t m a n n e r . M. tuberculosis-induced NETs were decorated with key ETotic markers such as histone H2A, H2B and NE and were able to trap but not kill M. tuberculosis .

What is the advantage of recombinant DNA systems?,"The advantage of recombinant DNA systems, such as the reBmBac system, is that they facilitate the large-scale preparation of high-quality DNA, which is a key factor for achieving good recombination results. Additionally, recombinant adenoviruses have attractive properties as vaccine vectors, including the ability to grow high-titer stocks, easily insert genes of interest, and induce robust immune responses. They also offer long-term storage capabilities and can infect a variety of hosts, tissues, and cell types. Furthermore, even replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses can be immunogenic, making them suitable for gene delivery, anti-cancer therapy, and vaccine development.","Recombinant DNA systems have several advantages, including the ability to produce antibodies without the need for immunization, the ease of modifying intrinsic properties using mutagenesis techniques, and the suitability for various downstream applications or conversion into functional whole immunoglobulins.

Why has pertussis immunity in infants has decreased in infants?,"Pertussis immunity in infants has decreased due to several factors, including rapidly waning immunity from those vaccinated with acellular vaccines. Acellular vaccines have been found to provide protection that is not as strong or long-lasting as that conferred by whole cell pertussis vaccines.

What is the hypothesized mechanism by which IFITMs work?,"IFITM proteins are hypothesized to work by inhibiting viral membrane fusion, resulting in cellular protection from a diverse range of infections. This mechanism allows IFITMs to provide cellular resistance to viral infection. Specifically, IFITM proteins are thought to interfere with the fusion of viral membranes with host cell membranes, thereby preventing the virus from entering the host cell. This antiviral activity is a key aspect of the IFITM proteins' function in protecting cells from viral infection.","The hypothesized mechanism by which IFITMs work is that they provide cellular resistance to viral infection and also regulate CD4+ Th cell differentiation and function. Additionally, they are also suggested to provide a negative feedback loop on Th1 differentiation in CD4+ T cells.","['Title: Rapid interferon independent expression of IFITM3 following T cell activation protects cells from influenza virus infection\nPassage: The pharmacological induction of IFITM3 could represent a broad-spectrum therapeutic treatment for a range of pathogenic agents. Although injection of type I IFN can induce IFITM3 and other antiviral responses, undesirable off target effects associated with this type of therapy limit its current clinical use. More refined approaches triggering the specific induction of antiviral proteins independently of IFN will provide antiviral resistance with minimal side effects. Here we show that IFITM3 can be up-regulated on T cells independent of IFN signalling.

Individuals homozygous for a 32 base pair deletion in CCR5 that disrupts its expression are largely HIV-1 resistant. Additionally, CCR5 is also involved in mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1, as reduced expression of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells might favour HIV-1 binding to CCR5 receptor, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier.","Yes, C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) does affect the transmission of HIV-1.

What is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors in the efficacy of vaccination?,"The host immune response to viral delivery vectors can have a negative impact on the efficacy of vaccination. Pre-existing immunity against viral vectors can lead to a reduction in the subsequent immune response, as the immune system may recognize and neutralize the vector before it can deliver the vaccine. This is particularly a problem with common viral vectors, such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population may have immunological memory against common serotypes. However, repeated immunization with the same vaccine and dose can counter this negative impact and lead to higher priming of naive T cells against the delivered antigen.","The effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors can greatly impact the efficacy of vaccination. The passage indicates that cell-mediated immunity against viral vectors often results in a reduction in the subsequent immune response, particularly because viruses can induce neutralizing antibodies and limit the number of transduced cells in subsequent doses. This can be a significant problem with common viral vectors, such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population may have immunological memory against common serotypes, potentially limiting the effectiveness of the vaccine.

What is the role of complement 5a (C5a) in increasing host resilience to viral lung infection?,"The provided context does not indicate that complement 5a (C5a) increases host resilience to viral lung infection.

Serological analysis helps to distinguish between the different types of viruses, which is essential for understanding their characteristics and behaviors.","Type A, B, and C viruses are determined based on serological analysis and their classification is based on the combinations of virus surface proteins, specifically hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes.","['Title: Dating the time of viral subtype divergence\nPassage: The study here focuses on influenza, although the techniques are readily applied to other rapidly evolving organisms. Influenza has three types, A, B and C, classified based on serological analysis. To date, only type A sequences have been demonstrably associated with global pandemics . Since modern surveillance began in the 1930s, type B has only been responsible for mild epidemics while type C has been nearly asymptomatic in human infection. Several subtypes of A, notably H1N1 and H3N2, are currently co-circulating in the human population. As the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes may be as divergent from each other as they', 'Title: Host and viral traits predict zoonotic spillover from mammals\nPassage: highest for Bunya-, Flavi-and Arenaviruses in rodents; Flavi-, Bunyaand Rhabdoviruses in bats; and Herpesviruses in non-human primates . Of 586 mammalian viruses in our dataset, 263 have been detected in humans, 75 of which are exclusively human and 188 zoonotic-defined operationally here as viruses detected at least once in humans and at least once in another mammal species . The proportion of zoonotic viruses is higher for RNA than DNA viruses. The observed number of viruses per wild host species was comparable when averaged across orders, but bats, primates, and rodents had a higher proportion of observed zoonotic viruses compared', 'Title: Virus Identification in Unknown Tropical Febrile Illness Cases Using Deep Sequencing\nPassage: We detected virus sequence at concentrations as low as ,2 in 10 6 reads. Virus sequence detected in a clinical sample at vanishingly low copy numbers may reflect several possible hostmicrobe scenarios. The sequence detected may be that of a pathogenic virus capable of causing illness at low copy number or through indirect effects, a ubiquitous non-disease causing microbe, a virus outside of its primary replication site, low-level contamination, an artifact of sample collection timing/processing, or remains of incomplete immune clearance. Additional evidence must be considered in each case to define the host-microbe relationship.', 'Title: Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of human metapneumovirus strains from Kenya and Zambia\nPassage: For the 143 HMPV genomes, we checked sequence conservation at transcriptional control regions, at the termini of each gene, as well as the lengths of intergenic sequences between gene boundaries. The length of the F-M2 intergenic region was different between group A and B viruses, that is, 13 nt and 2 nt, respectively. The SH-G and G-L intergenic regions were the longest, up to 125 nt and to 190 nt, respectively.

What factor positively correlates with imported-and-reported cases counts of SARS-CoV-2 infection?,"Daily air travel volume positively correlates with imported-and-reported case counts of SARS-CoV-2 infection among high surveillance locations. Specifically, an increase of 31 passengers per day is associated with one additional expected imported-and-reported case. This correlation suggests that areas with higher air travel volumes are more likely to have imported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",Daily air travel volume positively correlates with imported-and-reported case counts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"['Title: Identifying Locations with Possible Undetected Imported Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Cases by Using Importation Predictions,\nPassage: We found that daily air travel volume positively correlates with imported-and-reported case counts of SARS-CoV-2 infection among high surveillance locations . We noted that increasing flight volume by 31 passengers/day is associated with 1 additional expected imported-and-reported case. In addition, Singapore and India lie above the 95% PI in our model; Singapore had 12 more imported-and-reported cases than expected and India had 3 more than expected.
