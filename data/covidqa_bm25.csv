What role does T-cell count play in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection?,"According to the passage, a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe HAdV-55 infection. The only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts, while three of the five patients had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted, suggesting that they may have been relatively immunocompromised. This implies that a higher T-cell count may be associated with better outcomes in HAdV-55 infection.","The T-cell count plays a crucial role in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection, as patients with severe disease may have low T-cell counts.

This was true during the 1918 pandemic; although approximately one-third of the human population was infected, only a small proportion died.

In 2 of the 3 strains for which we were able to obtain longer sequences, RASs S556G and Q556R were observed.', 'Passage: to be the most common species among adults, as has been reported elsewhere. 8, 9, 11, 12, 14 HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were the most common strains in alternate seasons, reflecting a season-to-season variability of HCoV strain circulation that has been reported in other multiyear studies. 4 8 The mechanisms by which this particular species elicits these symptoms are not known.', 'Passage: least 17700 deaths worldwide and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 59 millions infected people in the USA ).']"
What do neuroaminidase inhibitors target?,"According to the passage, neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, target the neuraminidase enzyme of both influenza A and B viruses.","Neuroaminidase inhibitors target the neuraminidase enzyme, which plays a key role in the spreading of the virus and assists in the release of the virion progeny from infected cells.","['Passage: Annual immunization is the most important preventive measure . However, two classes of antiviral drugs are available and play an important role in the treatment and prevention of influenza : the neuraminidase inhibitors , oseltamivir and zanamivir, which are active against both influenza A and B viruses; and the M2 inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, which are active against all influenza A strains, but have no activity against influenza B viruses. In general, the duration for therapy with an NI is 5 days, and with the M2 inhibitors is three to 5 days.', 'Passage: Annual immunization is the most important preventive measure .

What was the purpose of this study?,"The purpose of the study is not explicitly stated in the provided passages. However, based on the context of the first passage, it appears that the study involved administering a questionnaire to participants to gather information about their attitudes or opinions on a particular topic, but the specific topic is not mentioned.","The purpose of the study was to investigate social network patterns in rural and urban schools and households in a coastal setting in Kenya using wearable proximity sensors, with a focus on understanding the nature of human networks within a low-resource population that have the potential to transmit respiratory infectious diseases. Additionally, the study aimed to provide greater insight into social network structures in resource-poor settings and compare and contrast patterns in the urban and rural setting exhibiting different demographic, economic, and socio-cultural characteristics. Finally, the study sought to answer how to optimize study design for transmission dynamic models for common respiratory viral and bacterial infections such as RSV and S. pneumoniae in the SSA setting.","['Passage: In both of the universities in which this study was conducted there are ethics committees which had been established for the purpose of determining the ethical appropriateness of pharmaceutical trials using humans; since our study involved only the use of a questionnaire and not an experimental drug, we did not apply for approval from either of these ethics committees. Instead, written permission to carry out the study was granted by the dean of the faculty of medicine and by the chief manager of university hospitals. In addition, all of the potential participants were fully informed about the aim and structure', 'Passage: To ensure success in the mission of shutting down the businesses that are still making money and that millions of people live on, the key issue is whether the decision maker and policy maker are aware of the extra dimension , which represents the single option that will result in apparent loss. In this sense, efforts to enhance environmental protection consciousness do, in fact, emphasize that there is an invisible ""green"" dimension. The purpose of thinking green is to make it clear that choosing to ""Chikui"" on an offered dimension that represents exploiting natural resource wealth will gain something on', 'Passage: Camel calving season occurs in the winter months and this may be a time when there is increased risk to humans of spill-over due to new infections among naïve DC populations . What role maternal camel antibody might play in delaying infection of calves remains unknown . Juvenile DCs appear to host active infection more often than adult DCs and thus the sacrificial slaughter of DCs, which must be five years of age or older , may not be accompanied by significant risk of exposure to infection. In contrast to earlier results, slaughterhouse workers who kill both younger and older', ""Passage: Crystallization Crystallization experiments and IDPs represent an inherent conflict, as crystallization requires very stable structures in order for diffraction to occur, and IDPs are very dynamic in nature. However, stabilizing these and other transient structures for the purpose of crystallization is possible, as demonstrated by the crystallization of Pup discussed earlier in this digest. Generally, crystallization of disordered proteins is facilitated by partners called 'crystallization chaperones'. A review by Bukowska et al. 76 summarizes the uses and applications of the most common crystallization chaperones and how they have been used to crystallize otherwise non-crystallizable structures. These approaches generally require other""]"
