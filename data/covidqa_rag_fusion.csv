What  effect the use of steroids to  suppress inflammation can have?,"The use of corticosteroids to suppress inflammation can have an immunosuppressive effect, which can lead to impaired bacterial immune response and increase the risk of opportunistic infections. This can result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Additionally, corticosteroids can also alter the nutrient profile in the airway, leading to changes in bacterial growth and further destabilization of the airway. Overall, the use of corticosteroids to suppress inflammation can have unintended consequences that may worsen disease outcomes.","The use of steroids to suppress inflammation can have side effects such as hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, osteopenia, and immunosuppression. However, it may also reduce the risk for side effects if used for a short period.","['Title: New aspects in the management of pneumonia\nPassage: The main side effects associated with corticosteroids, especially with prolonged use, are hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, brushing, and osteopenia . As well as these side effects, corticosteroids have strong immunosuppressive effects, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections, despite their potential effect in controlling excessive inflammatory response. The immunosuppressant effect of corticosteroids is related to dose and treatment duration. For example, the use of 40 mg of prednisolone per day for more than 1 week or 20 mg prednisolone or equivalent per day for a month can produce immunosuppression. In acute infection, a low dose for a short period', 'Title: Multiple Immunosuppressive Effects of CpG-c41 on Intracellular TLR-Mediated Inflammation\nPassage: The complex mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases remain poorly understood. The drugs currently in clinical use cannot effectively eliminate autoimmune diseases and may cause side effects. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that innate immune disorders are closely related to autoimmune diseases .

"Why is the determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission, an urgent priority?","The determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission is an urgent priority because it can significantly impact the spread of diseases, such as pandemic influenza and norovirus. Asymptomatic cases can still transmit the virus, making it difficult to track and contain outbreaks. Understanding the role of asymptomatic transmission is crucial for developing effective public health strategies, such as hygiene measures and social distancing policies, to mitigate the spread of diseases. Moreover, asymptomatic transmission can lead to a higher reproduction number, making it essential to identify and report such cases to prevent further transmission.","The determination of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission is an urgent priority because it has direct implications for public health and hospital infection control.

These cells are usually replaced by differentiation of recruited blood derived monocytes into macrophages of different polarization patterns. This in turn creates a delay in pathogen clearance and opens a window for host susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, colloquially named superinfections . In addition, induction of interferons', 'Title: Mucosal Vaccination with Recombinant Adenovirus Encoding Nucleoprotein Provides Potent Protection against Influenza Virus Infection\nPassage: respiratory mucosa may also be involved in the protection against the lethal influenza challenges , even though the exact mechanisms remain to be determined further. The immunization with adenovirus vector encoding NP induced both cellular and antibody responses. It has been shown recently that influenza virus-infected cells can be eliminated by anti-M2e IgG-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis since these cells express M2 on their surface after infection . Similarly, the NP-specific antibodies may interact with the viral NP expressed on cell surface of infected cells and mediate cell lysis by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.', 'Title: Vaccines and Therapeutics Against Hantaviruses\nPassage: Targeting viral RNAs is the most direct and effective way to curb hantaviral replication. Small interfering RNA directed against hantaviral genes could facilitate viral RNA clearance based on the RNA interfering mechanisms and has been tested as a potential antiviral strategy in vitro and in vivo. It has been demonstrated that siRNAs targeting the S, M, or L segment of ANDV could reduce viral replication in Vero E6 cells or human lung microvascular endothelial cells and that an S-targeted siRNA pool seemed to be more efficient in reducing viral transcription and replication than M-or L-targeted siRNA in Vero E6 cells.', 'Title: Characterization of Influenza A Virus Infection in Mouse Pulmonary Stem/Progenitor Cells\nPassage: Influenza virus can cause acute and severe respiratory diseases.

In our cohort, we found that severe HAdV-55 infection could cause a rapid progression of respiratory failure, with a very high failure rate for NPPV and IMV. This failure rate may be a result of the large area of consolidation that induced a severe shunt in the lung, which may lead to lack of response to positive pressure ventilation.

Why is the phage ab excellent model system for directed protein evolution?,"The filamentous phage is an excellent model system for directed protein evolution due to its large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes, and ease of manipulation. Additionally, its unique tolerance of genetic modifications allows biomolecules to be displayed on the virion surface, making it an ideal platform for protein engineering and directed protein evolution. This enables the display of variant Fabs and single-chain antibodies on the phage surface, which can be generated via random or site-directed mutagenesis and selected based on their affinity. The phage's ability to seamlessly connect genetic information with protein function for a large number of protein variants simultaneously has been widely exploited in studies of protein-protein interactions.","The phage is an excellent model system for directed protein evolution because their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes, and ease of manipulation make them ideal for experimental evolution and for displaying biomolecules on the virion surface for protein engineering purposes.","['Title: Beyond phage display: non-traditional applications of the filamentous bacteriophage as a vaccine carrier, therapeutic biologic, and bioconjugation scaffold\nPassage: Because of their large population sizes, short generation times, small genome sizes and ease of manipulation, various filamentous and non-filamentous bacteriophages have been used as models of experimental evolution .

What can happen  in response to the infection such as neutrophils?,"In response to infection, neutrophils can migrate from blood vessels to the site of infection, where they can internalize and kill microbes, perform tissue debridement, and attract monocytes to initiate healing. They can also be infected by viruses, which can modulate the production of various cytokines and chemokines. Additionally, neutrophils can promote chemotaxis of resident dendritic cells (DCs) toward virus-infected and dead cells. Furthermore, they can contribute to the transmigration of blood DCs, along with other immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, mDCs, and pDCs.","In response to infection, neutrophils can help to resolve tissue damage, form a defense against bacteria through phagocytosis and release of antimicrobial molecules, but they can also contribute to collateral organ damage of the host when released into tissues and enhance susceptibility to post-traumatic infections. Additionally, disrupted protective barriers in combination with the presence of immunosuppressive and less responsive neutrophils can further enhance the susceptibility to post-traumatic infections.","['Title: The Battle between Virus and Host: Modulation of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathways by Virus Infection\nPassage: and cytokines, such as interleukin-1β , IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and tumor necrosis factor-α are also produced.

What makes filamentous phage ideal scaffold for bioconjugation?,"The filamentous phage particle is an ideal scaffold for bioconjugation due to the regularity of its pVIII lattice and its diversity of chemically addressable groups. Specifically, each pVIII monomer exposes two amine groups and at least three carboxyl groups, making it suitable for functionalization. The regular arrangement of these groups allows for precise control over the conjugation of biomolecules to the phage surface. This property makes the filamentous phage an attractive platform for bioconjugation applications.","The regularity and diversity of chemically addressable groups on the filamentous phage pVIII lattice make it an ideal scaffold for bioconjugation.

Why do low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1?,"According to the passage, reduced expression of DC-SIGNR, particularly the membrane-bound isoforms, on placental capillary endothelial cells might favor HIV-1 binding to CCR5 receptor, instead of DC-SIGNR receptor, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier, resulting in mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. This is because DC-SIGNR normally binds to HIV-1, preventing it from binding to the CCR5 receptor, which is necessary for transmission. With low levels of DC-SIGNR, HIV-1 is more likely to bind to CCR5, allowing it to cross the placental barrier and infect the child.","Low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1 because reduced expression of DC-SIGNR on placental capillary endothelial cells might favor HIV-1 binding to the CCR5 receptor instead of the DC-SIGNR receptor, facilitating the migration of maternal HIV-1-infected cells across the placental barrier.

Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?,"According to the passage, it is likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells or patients due to the mouse adaptation. This is because the mouse-adapted SARS virus was generated by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice, resulting in six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. These mutations may have altered the virus's ability to replicate in human cells or patients.","The basis for the host-restriction of MVA, which is important to fully understand its attenuation, remains unknown. The large number of deletions, truncations, and mutations that occurred during the long passage history of MVA in CEF severely complicates efforts to determine those changes important for its host-range defect.

How does transmission differ between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV?,,"Transmission of SARS-CoV is more rapid between hosts, while MERS-CoV transmission is defined as sporadic, intra-familial, often healthcare associated, inefficient and requiring close and prolonged contact. Additionally, MERS-CoV has been more easily contained compared to SARS-CoV.","['Title: A mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel coronavirus\nPassage: 0.6 or 0.9 in Middle East countries . However, MERS had a high transmissibility in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea with the R 0 of 2.5-7.2 . Therefore, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than MERS in the Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS transmitted in the Republic of Korea.', 'Title: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: MERS and SARS have some clinical similarities but they also diverge significantly . Defining characteristics include the higher PFC among MERS cases and the higher association between fatal MERS and older males with underlying comorbidities. For the viruses, MERS-CoV has a broader tropism, grows more rapidly in vitro, more rapidly induces cytopathogenic change, triggers distinct transcriptional responses, makes use of a different receptor, induces a more proinflammatory state and has a delayed innate antiviral response compared to SARS-CoV.', 'Title: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: MERS and SARS have some clinical similarities but they also diverge significantly .

The two viruses have different receptors leading to different cellular tropism, and SARS-CoV is more ubiquitous in the cell type and species it can infect. SARS-CoV uses the ACE2 receptor to gain entry to cells, while MERS-CoV uses the ectopeptidase DPP4 . Unlike SARS-CoV infection, which causes primarily a severe respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV infection can also lead to kidney failure .

What leads to oxidative stress in the body?,"According to the passage, oxidative stress in the body is a result of the metabolic process, which produces a wide range of reactive species (RS). These RS can be either reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species. Previously, RS were considered to be toxic compounds, but recent studies have highlighted their involvement in complex cellular signaling pathways and their importance in several biological systems.","Oxidative stress in the body can be caused by a wide range of reactive species produced as a result of the metabolic process, including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. This can be magnified by the production of ROS from various cellular organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and peroxisomes. Additionally, factors such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, leptin, angiotensin II, and virus-induced cytokines can also contribute to oxidative stress in the body.","['Title: Oxidative Stress in Poultry: Lessons from the Viral Infections\nPassage: The theory of oxidative stress existed since the last 60 years. However, extensive research in the last three decades has clarified myriads of misconceptions and explored leading roles of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of many viral diseases .

What is theorized regarding transmission?,"According to the passages, it is theorized that the transmission bottleneck is dependent on the route of transmission, whether by contact or aerosol transmission. Additionally, superspreading, where a small proportion of individuals drive a large proportion of disease transmission, plays an important role in transmission dynamics. The identification of infected hosts and the implementation of isolation measures can disconnect the infection pathway, but delays and imperfect implementation can hinder their effectiveness. Furthermore, the transmission of infectious diseases can be influenced by social networks and human behavior, such as high-risk sexual or needle-sharing behaviors.","The passages discuss different aspects of viral transmission and the methods used to analyze and understand transmission dynamics. It is theorized that transmission is an important process underlying infectious disease dynamics, and different approaches are used to study and analyze transmission patterns in various populations. The passages also mention the use of population genetic methods and contact tracing to better understand the transmission of infectious diseases. Additionally, the importance of understanding viral transmission for disease control and evolution is emphasized.","['Title: A novel framework for inferring parameters of transmission from viral sequence data\nPassage: of neutral genetic markers has shown that the transmission bottleneck is dependent upon the route of transmission, whether by contact or aerosol transmission . In natural human influenza populations, where modification of the virus is not possible, population genetic methods have been used to analyse bottleneck sizes. Analyses of transmission have employed different approaches, exploiting the observation or non-observation of variant alleles or using changes in allele frequencies to characterise the bottleneck under a model of genetic drift . A recent publication improved this latter model, incorporating the uncertainty imposed upon allele frequencies by the process of within-host growth .', 'Title: Consequences of delays and imperfect implementation of isolation in epidemic control\nPassage: Isolation of infected hosts disconnects the infection pathway for diseases that are transmitted human-to-human and should, in principle, be 100% effective, yet it has not always stopped incipient outbreaks from burgeoning into full-blown epidemics. In this paper we called attention to the fact that a major reason may be ""too little, too late"", meaning the identification of infected hosts may not be sufficiently thorough and are too often subject to delays. We sought a mathematical model that could offer guidance on the response needed to contain an outbreak, as well as predict the consequences when one falls short. Our aim', ""Title: Autonomous Targeting of Infectious Superspreaders Using Engineered Transmissible Therapies\nPassage: From 'core groups' to 'superspreaders', epidemiologists have long recognized the immense potential of targeting high-risk groups for efficient control of infectious diseases . These groups are often described by the classic '80/20 rule' where 20% of the individuals drive 80% of disease transmission and thus dominate the overall pattern of disease prevalence. For sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections such as Hepatitis C , syphilis , and HIV-1 , superspreading is driven by high-risk sexual or needle-sharing behaviors. For many other pathogens, spanning a broad range of transmission modes and life histories, superspreading plays an important role in transmission dynamics but"", 'Title: Stochastic modelling of infectious diseases for heterogeneous populations\nPassage: There are some limitations in our proposed stochastic model. First, it does not consider the epidemic network topology. However, how to infer such networks is another challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, the best way to do so is to use the contact data among some infected patients to verify the results, but such data are not always available and can be difficult to collect due to many issues . This issue may be addressed by using other types of data, such as daily commute data extracted from social networks. Second, our proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy', 'Title: Study design and protocol for investigating social network patterns in rural and urban schools and households in a coastal setting in Kenya using wearable proximity sensors\nPassage: The general objective of this work is to utilize radio frequency close-proximity sensors to describe and understand the nature of human networks within a low-resource population that have the potential to transmit respiratory infectious diseases.

How can DNA arise chemically from RNA?,"According to the passage, DNA can arise chemically from RNA through the formation of deoxyribozymes from ribonucleotides, without the need for the key protein enzyme, reverse transcriptase. This suggests that RNA can be converted into DNA through a chemical process, bypassing the need for enzymatic catalysis. This process is possible because deoxyribozymes can form from ribonucleotides, allowing for the chemical conversion of RNA into DNA.","DNA can arise from RNA chemically without the key protein enzyme, the reverse transcriptase. RNA molecules can become longer through heat flow across an open pore in submerged rocks, which concentrates replicating oligonucleotides from a constant feeding flow and selection for longer strands.","['Title: Viruses and Evolution – Viruses First?

Pol I transcribes rDNA to produce the 47S rRNA, which is the precursor of the mature 28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNAs. Together with the 5S rRNA transcribed by Pol III in the nucleoplasm, these rRNAs form the nucleic acid backbone of the ribosome. The other major components of the ribosome are the~78 ribosomal proteins , whose genes are transcribed by Pol II, and are assembled with the rRNAs to form functional ribosomes', 'Title: Efficient generation of recombinant RNA viruses using targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing full-length cDNA\nPassage: passages within bacteria. The complete genome sequences of rescued viruses, after extensive passages in mammalian cells showed that modifications in the E2 protein coding sequence were stably maintained. A single amino acid substitution in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase was observed in the rescued viruses vR26_E2gif and vR26, which was reversion to the parental Riems sequence. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis provides a powerful tool for expediting the construction of novel RNA genomes and should be applicable to the manipulation of other RNA viruses.']"
