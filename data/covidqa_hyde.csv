What role does T-cell count play in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection?,"According to the passage, a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe HAdV-55 infection. The study found that three out of five patients with severe infection had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted. In contrast, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. This suggests that T-cell count may play a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV viremia and survival of the host.","The T-cell count plays a crucial role in severe human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) infection, as patients with severe disease may have low T-cell counts. In the study mentioned, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts, suggesting that a lower T-cell count may be a risk factor for severe HAdV-55 infection.","['Passage: Recent studies have shown that the immune system plays a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV viremia and survival of the host . Chen et al. reported that, in the acute phase of HAdV-55 infection, patients with severe disease may have high levels of dendritic cells and Th17 cells . In our study, the only patient who recovered from severe infection had higher T-cell counts. Three of the five patients had relatively low T-cell counts when admitted. Our results suggest that these three patients may have been relatively immunocompromised and that a lower T-cell count may be a risk', 'Passage: Our study results suggest that the following may be clinical features of ARDS caused by HAdV-55: persistent high fever, rapid progression of dyspnea, need for mechanical ventilation support, elevated AST level and rapid progression from unilateral infiltrates to bilateral consolidations. These clinical features are highly similar to those of ARDS caused by other types of HAdV described in previous reports .', 'Passage: respiratory mucosa may also be involved in the protection against the lethal influenza challenges , even though the exact mechanisms remain to be determined further. The immunization with adenovirus vector encoding NP induced both cellular and antibody responses. It has been shown recently that influenza virus-infected cells can be eliminated by anti-M2e IgG-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis since these cells express M2 on their surface after infection . Similarly, the NP-specific antibodies may interact with the viral NP expressed on cell surface of infected cells and mediate cell lysis by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.', 'Passage: T-cell-secreted cytokines have also been implicated in the development of severe disease . Specifically, a theory known as original antigenic sin proposes that memory T-cell populations with low avidity for the infecting virus of a heterologous secondary infection cause a strong pro-inflammatory response, as would any memory T-cell population activated by a secondary infection. Yet, because of their low avidity, the ability of these T cells to lyse infected cells, and thereby to protect against viral infection, may be poor . In support of OAS, a study of dengue virus-specific T-cell responses in Thai children showed that the majority of', 'Passage: immunosuppression, specific comorbidities-chronic lung disease, heart disease, blood disorders-elderly and living in long-term care facilities are associated with a higher risk of severe viral pneumonia . Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that hMPV infection is an underappreciated cause of critical illness, also in previously healthy patients .']"

In cancer cells v-ATPases are expressed on the plasma membrane in order to eliminate toxic cytosolic H + . Most importantly, v-ATPases contribute to the acidic tumor microenvironment, which leads to the activation of proteases, thus facilitating tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis .

What have sero-surveys of MERS virus found?,"According to the passage, sero-surveys of MERS virus have found no sign of MERS-CoV antibodies among 2,400 sera from patients visiting a hospital in Jeddah from 2010 through 2012, prior to the description of MERS-CoV.

The case first to be publicly reported was from Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Since then, MERS-CoV sequences have been found in a bat and in many dromedary camels .

How were untreated MDA-MB-231 cells labeled?,The passage does not mention how untreated MDA-MB-231 cells were labeled.
